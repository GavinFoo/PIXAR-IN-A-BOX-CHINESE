- To see how to put the diagrams together,

3
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,314
let's go back to the example where we had

4
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:11,274
just two kinds of parts, heads and bodies.

5
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:15,534
Suppose I pick, umm,
this head and this body.

6
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:18,205
Or, I can pick this body, or this one,

7
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,374
let's finish off all the possibilities.

8
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:22,575
Notice that the bottom of the diagram

9
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:25,945
has six combinations as before.

10
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:27,937
And the diagram, hopefully, makes it clear

11
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:30,454
that we have two choices of
heads and for each of those,

12
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:32,378
we have three choices of bodies.

13
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:37,137
Or, two times three combinations.

14
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,711
Use the next interactive to figure out

15
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,719
what the diagram would look
like if there were a different

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,006
number of heads and a
different number of bodies.
