00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:05,801
- The advantage of this diagram,
is that since it represents

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:08,239
all of the choices you
have, we can just add more

4
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:10,571
and more choices to the bottom.

5
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:14,138
So, if we have two heads and
three bodies and three arms,

6
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,145
then the diagram would look like this,

7
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:20,605
for a total of two
times three times three,

8
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:24,243
or 18 different combinations.

9
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:26,529
These are sometimes called
tree diagrams, because

10
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,084
when you turn them over,
they look a lot like a tree.

11
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,988
The diagram has helped us
understand that we just need

12
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:34,852
to multiple the number
of each kind of part.

13
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:36,520
So, if we're just interested
in how many combinations

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,597
are needed, we don't
need the diagram anymore.

15
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:42,987
And, the number of
combinations gets big fast.

16
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:46,776
For instance, if we had
five heads, six bodies,

17
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:50,193
and seven arms, and say, eight
different kinds of wheels

18
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:53,482
on our robots, we would
have to build five plus six

19
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:57,962
plus seven plus eight, or 26
different kinds of objects.

20
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:01,508
But, we could build five times
six times seven times eight,

21
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:06,107
or 1,680 different robots.

22
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,281
Because there are so many
possible combinations,

23
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,165
it's easy to go crazy and
build a huge crowd of robots.

24
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:14,544
(robots flying through the air
and rolling across the floor)

25
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:16,444
(crashing and squeaking)

26
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,286
- Emmet!

27
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,165
- While a big crowd of robots might make

28
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:21,532
the film more exciting,
we have to keep in mind

29
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:22,937
that the more robots there are,

30
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,290
the more robots the
animators have to animate

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,810
and the more robots the
computer needs to deal with.

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,084
So, we're always trying
to achieve our artisticals

33
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:32,824
in the most efficient way possible.

34
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,896
Now, it's time to put you to work.

35
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,622
Your job with this interactive,
is to make both the director

36
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,483
and the producer happy.

37
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:41,653
You should have a wide variety of robots,

38
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,513
so that there's a lot of visual interest

39
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:45,751
and the director is happy with your work.

40
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,571
But, you should keep the cost down,

41
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,461
so that the producer is
happy with your work.

42
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:54,125
The cost of each part is shown,
select a subset of heads,

43
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,541
bodies, and arms so that combining
them in all possible ways

44
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,523
gives exactly 12 robots and
the cost of all the parts

45
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:04,950
must be below $300.

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,306
The director and producer
will be here in 10 minutes

47
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:08,990
to review your work.

48
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,000
I know you got this. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
