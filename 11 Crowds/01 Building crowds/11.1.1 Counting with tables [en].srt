- Hi, I'm Fran Kalal.

3
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm a cloth and sim technical director

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,097
at Pixar Animation Studios.

5
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:13,662
That means I get to take what I know about art and design

6
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:15,432
and make outfits, and what I know

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,719
about math and physics to make them move.

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,074
I'm here today to talk to you about crowds

9
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,358
like the large one behind me.

10
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,713
Except that the one behind me is physical,

11
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:26,661
and the ones we need to make

12
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,277
for our films are virtual.

13
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:31,760
That means they exist only on the computer.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,561
We saw in the last video how lots of robots were made

15
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,063
using only a few parts through

16
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,792
the use of combinatorics.

17
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,021
So follow me to learn more about

18
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:42,932
what combinatorics is and how we use it at Pixar.

19
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:52,520
To understand how many robots we can make

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,039
from a bin of parts, let's start with an example

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,944
where a robot has one head and one body.

22
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:02,510
And I've got two different heads to choose from

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,992
and three different bodies.

24
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:09,407
So I can take this head with this body,

25
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:12,834
or this same head with this body,

26
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,659
and that's already two different robots.

27
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,916
And clearly I can make a whole lot more.

28
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,424
A great way to keep track of this is with a table

29
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:23,102
where I'm going to place the heads along the columns

30
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:26,125
and the bodies along the rows.

31
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:30,108
This cell means put this head on this body.

32
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:31,572
There are six cells on the table,

33
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:33,034
so there are six different robots

34
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:36,295
even though we only have five different parts.

35
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:37,925
This is a great example of the fact

36
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,917
that finding a good way to think about a problem

37
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,131
makes it easier to solve.

38
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:43,230
How many robots could you make

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,311
if there were different numbers of heads and bodies?

40
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:50,000
You can explore that question in the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
