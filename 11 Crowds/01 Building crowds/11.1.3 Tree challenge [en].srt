00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:06,140
- Great work, but suppose the director decides

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,883
that we need robots made up of a little more variety

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:11,210
and now, we need three kinds of parts;

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,087
heads, bodies, and arms.

6
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:16,553
When there are three parts to combine,

7
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:18,504
the table doesn't work anymore.

8
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:20,872
We need some other way to think about all the different ways

9
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:23,664
that three parts can be combined.

10
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:26,307
It would be even better if we can think of a way that works

11
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:31,983
for two, or three, or four, or even more kinds of parts.

12
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,148
When I first start trying to solve a new problem,

13
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,440
I like to break that problem down

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,340
into a bunch of smaller parts that are easier to solve.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,887
In this case, counting the number of robots made

16
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:44,776
from two heads and three bodies.

17
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:47,307
I can illustrate the two ways of selecting a head

18
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:50,170
using a picture like this.

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,014
And, I can illustrate the three ways of selecting a body

20
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,930
using a picture like this.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,437
The problem with these picture so far is, they make it look

22
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:01,846
like there are only five possible combinations.

23
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:03,862
Before moving on to the next video,

24
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,976
see if you can combine these two diagrams

25
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:09,000
to show that there are six different combinations of robots. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
