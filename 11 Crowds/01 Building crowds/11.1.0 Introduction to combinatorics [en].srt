PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:01,758
- Hi, my name is Lou Hamou-Lhadj.

3
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:03,468
I'm a Character TD here at Pixar.

4
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:06,156
- Hi, I'm Jacob Speirs, I'm
also a Character TD at Pixar.

5
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:10,117
- [Lou] We started here at
Pixar on WALL-E as interns

6
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,833
and our task was to make a
huge cast of background robots.

7
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,391
- Today's lesson is going
to be about how to create

8
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,698
a huge crowd of robots using
only a few simple parts.

9
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:20,157
(mechanical clicks)

10
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:22,539
- I wanna take WALL-E from a world

11
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,934
where there's no robots anymore

12
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,039
and it's just him to a world
where there's tons of them.

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,447
I just like that contrast
and suddenly making him feel

14
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:30,420
like he was alone in a crowd.

15
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,125
- We're trying to create a
world where robots do every task

16
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,103
that you would want done.

17
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,244
What we did first was
to look at cruise ships.

18
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:41,381
We got a list of every
single job on a cruise ship

19
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,725
and then went through
and tried to think of

20
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,337
the robotic equivalent of that job

21
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,565
and it became apparent quickly
that that was more robots

22
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,746
than we would ever be able
to build in one lifetime.

23
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:54,290
- So as interns, Jacob and I
had the task of making this

24
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,067
huge cast of robots, but we
didn't want to design each

25
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,319
individual one specifically.

26
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:01,151
- Right, so luckily there
was an animator, Angus,

27
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:04,275
and he had a great idea about
how to approach the process.

28
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,568
- I'm a huge Lego fan and I really wanted

29
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,584
the background characters
to be the best they could be

30
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:12,102
and I figured if we
designed a modular system

31
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:15,249
that would allow for us to add
and subtract different parts

32
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,524
onto the character for
the background characters

33
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:20,019
then we could kinda
make whatever we needed

34
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,040
and it would all feel like the same world.

35
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,699
- [Lou] Doing it this way, modularly,

36
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:26,184
meant we could build 10
heads, 10 arms, and 10 bodies

37
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:27,718
and though we'd only built 30 pieces

38
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:29,004
we could make a thousand
different combinations.

39
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,464
- Yeah, and there's actually
a branch of mathematics

40
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:35,241
about that sort of thing,
counting and combinations

41
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,230
and it's called combinatorics.

42
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,028
(mechanical noises)

43
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:40,895
- Combinatorics is actually
what your lesson today

44
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:41,703
is gonna be about.

45
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,262
We're gonna start with a few small pieces

46
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:45,000
and build a huge cast of
robots just like we did. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
