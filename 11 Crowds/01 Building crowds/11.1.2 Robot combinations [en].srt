00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:05,973
 In the previous clip and exercise, we saw a table 

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,254
 can easily monitor various 

4
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:11,124
 robots, each has a head 

5
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:12,967
 and one body. 

6
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:16,787
 Each of these robots combination. 

7
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:19,160
 Constantly we are dealing with combinations. 

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,878
 For example, when we in the morning 

9
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:23,520
 and choose your top and bottoms. 

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,372
 This is also combining. 

11
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:27,659
 Since each box in the table corresponds 

12
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,015
 a different combination, just count 

13
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:34,692
 cells but do not have to be one by one. 

14
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:36,392
 This is because the number of cells in tabiltsata 

15
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:39,907
 equals the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns. 

16
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,932
 With two heads and three bodies 

17
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:46,549
 there are two three, i.e. six combinations. 

18
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,567
 With three heads and four bodies 

19
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:53,210
 we have three in four, ie twelve combinations. 

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,728
 The following exercise will allow 

21
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:58,000
 to try other combinations.  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
