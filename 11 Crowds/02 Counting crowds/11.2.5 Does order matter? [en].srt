- Good work!

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,630
I left you with this question:

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,560
Why are there exactly six combinations of each cast

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,890
when you select three actors from a group of four?

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,597
To get a feeling for what's up,

7
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:17,770
let's look at the first two boxes.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,353
Notice that in the first cast, or box,

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:25,070
we have all possible orderings of A, B, and C.

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,160
Mathematicians call each of these orderings a permutation.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,580
Now, the number of permutations is represented

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,920
by the number of rows in each box.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,380
The same is true in the second cast involving A, B, and D.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,510
How many orderings, or permutations,

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,009
are there of three things?

16
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,470
We saw earlier that there are three

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,340
factorial, or six permutations.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,060
Bingo! That's it!

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,980
To keep order for mattering, we need to take

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,560
the total number of combinations where order does matter

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,780
and divide that by all the possible permutations.

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,030
So when choosing three actors from four actors total,

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,690
we can write our calculation as

24
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,450
four times three times two

25
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,790
over three factorial, which equals four.

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,330
Let's do another example and figure out how many casts

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,200
we can form with three actors from a pool of six actors.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,510
In this case, there would be six times five times four.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,959
We then have to again divide by three factorial

30
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,550
to keep the order from mattering,

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,640
leaving six times five times four

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,099
over three factorial, which equals 20.

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,610
So there are 20 different casts in this case.

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,360
Use the next exercise to get some practice

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,150
with some other examples.

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,060
And perhaps you'll recognize our good friend

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,000
