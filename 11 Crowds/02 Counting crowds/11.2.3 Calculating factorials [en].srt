00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,800
- Nice work!

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,850
Suppose we wanted four-segment Snake Bots

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,840
as in the previous exercise.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,100
How many of those are there?

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,690
Well, we have four choices for the first segment,

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,440
three choices for the second segment,

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,150
two choices for the third segment,

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,360
and one choice for the fourth segment.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,570
So that's four times three times two times one,

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,450
which multiplies out to 24.

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,240
Isn't it interesting that you can make 24 different

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,630
Snake Bots using only four different objects?

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,330
And it gets better!

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,079
Suppose you wanted a ten-segment Snake Bot.

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,290
Then you could make ten times nine

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,670
times eight times seven times six times five times four

18
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,752
times three times two times one different combination!

19
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,800
Which amounts to a whopping 3,628,800

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,924
different ten-segment Bots!

21
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,100
And you only have to build ten different objects!

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,270
These kinds of calculations appear all the time

23
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,690
in combinatorics, so of course mathematicians

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,520
invented a name and a shorthand for them.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,860
They're called factorials, and they're

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,019
represented with an exclamation point.

27
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,700
For instance, four exclamation point,

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,120
or four factorial, stands for four

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,040
times three times two times one.

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,670
So four factorial is 24,

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,250
five factorial is 120,

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,459
and 10 factorial is over three million!

33
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,959
Wow! That's a combinatorial explosion of choices!

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,090
(glass-shattering blast)

35
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,099
Let's pause now and practice this concept

36
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,000
in the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
