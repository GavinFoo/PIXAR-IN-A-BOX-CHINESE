- Great job completing the last tutorial!

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,340
You made both the director and the producer very happy.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,270
Sometimes our directors change their minds when they see

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,120
their drawings translated to 3D computer graphics.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,770
In fact, sometimes our directors change their minds a lot,

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,302
and we need to be able to adapt to those changes.

8
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,390
So let's say we have a director that wants a robot

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,610
with two heads, but each head has to be different.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,273
That is, the director doesn't want a robot

11
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:29,660
with two copies of the same head.

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,750
Now a robot consists of two heads, a body, and arms.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,210
We'd like to know how many of those we can have

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,370
if we have H heads, B bodies, and A arms.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,130
We saw that by using a Tree Diagram we could multiply

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,380
the number of each kind of part together

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,260
to get the total number of combinations.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,480
Well, we have H choices for the first head,

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,310
but since the second head has to be different,

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,690
we only have H minus one choices for the second head.

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,069
As before, we have B choices for bodies

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,860
and A choices for arms, for a total

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,739
of H times H minus one

24
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,330
times B times A combinations.

25
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,079
So it's all about multiplying together

26
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,040
all the choices you have at each stage.

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,670
Mathematicians make up words for everything.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,709
They use the word combinatorics

29
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,130
to refer to this type of counting.

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,630
The next exercise will give you a chance

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,000
to practice with other combinations. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
