00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:04,484
- Nice work.

3
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:05,746
Thanks for stickin' with us.

4
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:07,713
We're at the last step of the lesson.

5
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:10,965
Earlier, I promised you a powerful counting formula.

6
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:14,007
Let's work together to see if we can develop that formula.

7
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:19,884
First notice that 6 x 5 x 4
looks a little like a factorial

8
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:24,007
except that it's missing the 3 x 2 x 1.

9
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,362
That means we can write 6 x 5 x 4

10
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:32,073
using factorials as 6! over 3!.

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:37,271
Because 6! equals 6 x 5 x 4 x 3!

12
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:43,654
So dividing by 3! just leaves 6 x 5 x 4.

13
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,421
That means, we can rewrite

14
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:50,904
our earlier example as 6! over 3! x 3!.

15
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:54,444
To generalize this for other numbers of actors,

16
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:57,592
let n be the number of actors we can pick from

17
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:00,814
and let k be the size of the cast.

18
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:04,666
On the first pick, we have n choices.

19
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:09,090
Then, on the second pick, we have n-1 choices and so on.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,775
Notice that the number being subtracted

21
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:14,155
is one less than the choice number.

22
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:19,843
So, on the kth choice, you have n - (k-1) choices

23
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:23,968
which is n - k +1.

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,712
Multiplying the choices together gives

25
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:30,464
n x n - 1 through n - k + 1

26
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:36,986
which can be written as n! over (n-k)!.

27
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:40,667
Now, we have to divide by k!

28
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,551
because there are k! ways to order the k choices.

29
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:48,102
So, finally, we get to, wait for it.

30
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:50,501
Drum roll, please!

31
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:55,286
n! over k!(n-k)! possible casts of k actors

32
00:01:57,286 --> 00:02:00,437
chosen from a group of n actors total.

33
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:01,918
This formula is so famous

34
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:05,087
that it has a special name and a special symbol to write it.

35
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,872
It's called a binomial coefficient

36
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,964
and mathematicians write it as

37
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:14,907
n choose k equals n! divided by k! (n-k)!.

38
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,330
It's powerful because you can use it

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,670
whenever you're selecting a small number of things

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,024
from a larger number of choices.

41
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:26,319
With this tool, we can easily compute, say,

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,779
how many casts of 4
robots I can come up with

43
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:32,374
when I have, let's say, 12
different robots to choose from.

44
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:35,542
There are 12 choose 4, which,

45
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:39,758
if you work it out, is exactly 495.

46
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:44,178
Your final challenge, should you choose to accept it,

47
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:45,497
is to answer some final questions

48
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,752
with the binomial coefficient formula

49
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:50,556
and there won't be any diagrams to help you this time.

50
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,789
And, you'll be asked to count something other than robots,

51
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,000
like, let's say, plants, or sandwiches, or outfits. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
