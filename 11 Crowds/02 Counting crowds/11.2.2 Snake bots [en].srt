00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,890
- In the rest of this
lesson, we're gonna look

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,600
at a few other counting
problems that come up

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,190
when you try to make a large crowd

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,930
of robots from a small bin of parts.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,714
We're gonna be building up
to a really powerful formula

7
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,520
that you can think of as a counting tool.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,059
(chimes ringing)

9
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,030
To start, let's imagine snake-like robots.

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,110
Let's call them Snake Bots.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,990
They are built as a sequence of segments

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,030
where every segment must
be used exactly once.

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,450
For instance, if I'm building
a three-segment Snake Bot,

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,500
I might assemble the segments this way.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,420
Or I could do it this way.

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,783
We'd again like to know:

17
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,590
How many of these Snake Bots can I build?

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,970
Remember, you have to account
for every possibility.

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,009
In the next exercise,
you're gonna be asked

20
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,890
to build all possible Snake
Bots of length one through four.

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,000
