PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:05,926
- Earlier, you created
a small crowd of robots

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:09,803
by choosing just a few of the
possible robot combinations.

4
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,998
Let's back up a bit and
go back to the example

5
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:16,799
where robots consisted of
one head, and one body.

6
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,356
If you have two heads, and two bodies,

7
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:23,013
then you can make two times
two, or four, different robots.

8
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:25,919
That's like having four
possible actors to choose from

9
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:29,616
but you only need a cast
of three in your movie.

10
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,424
Let's give our actors names:

11
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:34,776
Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave,

12
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:38,715
or A, B, C, and D, for short.

13
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:41,746
That leads to an interesting question:

14
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,024
how many different casts of
three actors can you make

15
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,886
when you have four actors to choose from?

16
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,715
Remember that, to figure
out how many ways there are

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,197
to combine our actors, we need

18
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,611
to multiply our choices at each stage.

19
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:57,308
In this case, we have four
choices for our first actor,

20
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,297
three for the second,
and two for the third.

21
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:05,046
So, it seems like we have 4 x
3 x 2, or 24, possible casts.

22
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:09,561
Let's list out all 24 combinations.

23
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,730
The first combination,
ABC, means we selected

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,001
Alice then Bob and then Carol,

25
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,703
but there's a subtlety lurking in there.

26
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,896
There aren't 24 different casts.

27
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:23,802
To see where the subtlety is,

28
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:27,601
notice that the second combination, ACB,

29
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:31,010
means we selected Alice
then Carol and then Bob.

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,686
So, the first two combinations
use the same actors,

31
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:36,185
just in a different order.

32
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:39,400
The same is true for
the other combinations

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,822
in the first box.

34
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,468
It's the same cast.

35
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:45,312
Just the order that we
picked from was different.

36
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,261
In other words, all the combinations

37
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:50,619
in the first box should be
counted as just one cast.

38
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,502
Similarly, the second box is a cast

39
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:57,883
consisting of Alice, Bob, and Dave.

40
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,193
The total number of casts is,

41
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,992
therefore, the number of boxes.

42
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:05,655
So, how many boxes are there?

43
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:08,295
Since there are six
combinations in each box,

44
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:13,559
there must be 24 divided
by six, or four, boxes.

45
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,037
So, there are four casts.

46
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,050
But why is it that each group

47
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,325
contains exactly six sequences?

48
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:24,586
Why not three or four or any other number?

49
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:27,291
The next interactive will help
you visualize this problem

50
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,770
using a few other examples.

51
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,000
Have fun! aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
