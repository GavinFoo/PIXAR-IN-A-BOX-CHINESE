1
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:02,183
- Welcome to Pixar In A Box

2
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:04,459
a collaboration between Pixar Animation Studios

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,263
- and the Khan Academy.

4
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,516
- I'm Fran, I work here on the technical side of things.

5
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:09,519
- And I'm Alex, I work here

6
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:11,565
on the art and story side of things.

7
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:13,081
- (Fran) Pixar In A Box will introduce you

8
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,257
to some of the fundamental skills we use to make our movies.

9
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,319
- (Alex) There's examples of real life film challenges

10
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,152
that show how an artist's idea can create

11
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,979
a tidal wave of technical creativity.

12
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,767
And how technical advances can inspire

13
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,773
artists to think of new ideas to bring to the screen.

14
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,875
You'll meet artists, scientists,

15
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,001
animators, coders, sculptors,

16
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,590
all kinds of different people.

17
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,078
- And the thing is, most of them use

18
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,712
skills you may already be learning in school.

19
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,825
But here in the Box, you can see how

20
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,296
we use those skills to make cool stuff.

21
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:41,340
Before you dive into these lessons,

22
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:43,865
you should see how it all fits together inside Pixar,

23
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:44,917
the real Pixar.

24
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:45,780
Come on, check it out.

25
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:49,887
(light, flittering music)

26
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:52,464
- At Pixar on any given day

27
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:54,888
we're working on various stages of many films.

28
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,102
- But it all begins with an idea.

29
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:02,134
For example, "Toy Story" could have started like this.

30
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:06,528
[John Lasseter] When kids leave the room the toys come to life.

31
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:09,949
See I always knew that my toys did that.

32
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:16,770
(scampering instrumental music)

33
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,794
- Our films start in story,

34
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:21,122
along with the director and the writer

35
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,176
we figure out what happens using simple drawings.

36
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:25,337
- (Fran) It's kind of like a comic book.

37
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,594
- (Alex) Exactly, and while we're drawing,

38
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:29,359
production designers and their team start

39
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,640
designing the world and the characters.

40
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:36,016
(smooth, cheerful orchestral music)

41
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,099
While they're painting and drawing and scultping

42
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,195
our storyboards go to editorial,

43
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:43,518
where they string together all

44
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,167
the drawings that we've created.

45
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:48,448
- We time them out, add music, dialogue and sound effects.

46
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:49,029
(clicking)

47
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,124
- He's the only one who knew what the heck was going

48
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,061
aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

49
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,517
- And as these shots go through each stage in production,

50
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:57,164
we'll update the scene over and over again.

51
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:59,765
And this is where the science and the math come in.

52
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:00,741
- Who knew what the heck was going

53
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,436
aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

54
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,364
(mischevious music)

55
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:07,477
- What's next?

56
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:10,240
Pipeline, we're ready to start making the film you'll see

57
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:12,555
in the theater and this happens in a particular order.

58
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,787
It's time for our technical artist to figure out

59
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,934
how we're going to create the movie in the computer.

60
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,408
- I've been here for nine years and I still have no idea

61
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:22,032
how you guys turn our drawings into the finished film.

62
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,097
- To be honest, something stumps us on every movie.

63
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:26,165
- Hey Galyn.

64
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:26,223
- Hey.

65
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,463
- You've been here since Toy Story,

66
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,666
what's been hard on each film?

67
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,450
- Well on Toy Story everything.

68
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,171
Here let me show you.

69
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,595
On Toy Story we were inventing

70
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:38,288
the entire process from scratch.

71
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:41,121
Monsters Incorporated, fur and clothing.

72
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,130
On Cars, reflective metal surfaces.

73
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:47,762
On every new film there's a new technical challenge.

74
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:49,280
On Inside Out we had to deal with a character

75
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,575
made of glowing particles and it took lots

76
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:54,876
of people to figure out just that one thing.

77
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,524
- (Alex) Whoa, what is she made of?

78
00:02:56,524 --> 00:03:00,239
- Her shape will be made of points and particles of light.

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,965
She was tough, this is the 17th version.

80
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:06,604
- And the characters have to move,

81
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,277
so someone has to add controls to the model.

82
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:10,652
- Like a puppet, right?

83
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:11,744
- Yes, except instead of strings,

84
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,503
our animators will use a computer program

85
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:15,935
to move the characters in a digital world.

86
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,653
(bemused music)

87
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:19,409
Next in the pipeline, sets.

88
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,582
(playful music)

89
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:23,667
- (Alex) So for Cars 2 you built the entire city of London?

90
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,669
- We needed a huge chunk of the city

91
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,753
because Mayor and McQueen speed through it.

92
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:29,959
So we figured out to grow buildings

93
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,250
with enough variation for them to look real.

94
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,418
- (Fran) And we move through that set

95
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:37,128
with our virtual cameras.

96
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,753
Next up, animation.

97
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:39,821
- I do know what the animators do.

98
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,894
They bring the characters to life.

99
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:43,920
- (Fran) You see how she's moving but

100
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:45,657
her clothes and hair are missing?

101
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,846
Adding and moving those elements is going to be

102
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:49,697
someone else's job further down the pipeline.

103
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,144
And by somebody else, I mean me

104
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,698
and about 20 other simulation technical artists.

105
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,700
Where are you getting all these shirts?

106
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:58,934
We have to build everything you see,

107
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:01,111
including the textures and surfaces

108
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,850
which help make the world and characters believable.

109
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:05,712
Next stop, lighting.

110
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,630
- Ironically it's really dark in the lighting department.

111
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,531
(playful music)

112
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,424
So when you start, there are no lights?

113
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:14,798
- No any source of light is something

114
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,751
we have to add into the scene.

115
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,765
In this shot alone there are 230 lights.

116
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,762
- (Fran) Last stop, the Renderfarm.

117
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,571
- A film is really a series of images or frames.

118
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,274
There's 24 of them every second.

119
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:28,333
(light, moving music)

120
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:29,932
- (Fran) This is where we make the frames.

121
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:31,841
Everything comes together here,

122
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:34,302
all the art, math and science.

123
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:38,040
A single frame can take more than 24 hours to render,

124
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,769
and that's just one frame,

125
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,662
and that's assuming we don't run into any snags.

126
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,377
- Whoa! (thuds)

127
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:49,069
(soaring orchestral music)

128
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,486
- Wow, it's incredible seeing final shots.

129
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:56,130
And now that I know how they're made, even cooler.

130
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:57,790
- So that's the tour, our next step is to

131
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:59,896
jump back into the Box and choose a lesson.

132
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,447
What do you want to try?

133
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:03,838
- Well this one on building robots using combinatorics,

134
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,440
that looks pretty cool.

135
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,855
- What about the one on sets and staging?

136
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:09,543
- Yeah or the one on animating The Incredibles.

137
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,935
- (Fran) Awesome, I always wanted to animate.

138
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,739
(silly trumpet music)
