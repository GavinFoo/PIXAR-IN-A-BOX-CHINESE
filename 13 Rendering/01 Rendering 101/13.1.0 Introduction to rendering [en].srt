PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,979
Hello. Hold on for just a second, please.
Welcome to "Rendering."

3
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm Christophe Hery and
I'm a researcher at Pixar.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,309
Rendering is the last phase of
the pipline and film production

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,820
that takes our movies
from this to this.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,850
Rendering is where the world we've created
in the virtual three-dimensional space

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,039
of the computer is finally realized
as a series of perfectly rendered

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,990
two-dimensional images
that play one after another

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,100
for 96 minutes and
become our movie.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,510
Rendering is an incredibly
time-consuming process,

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,310
all focused on answering
one simple question:

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,000
"What color is this pixel –
and then this pixel –

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,049
and then this pixel
and this pixel?"

14
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,100
Seems simple enough.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,260
I mean, the balloon is blue,
so the pixel will be blue, right?

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,000
Well not exactly.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,899
A pixel is a tiny portion
of the final image.

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,000
It acts like a little window
into the virtual 3D world.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,058
To understand what
color it should be,

20
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:05,139
we have to figure out
what part of the picture

21
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,920
we see through that window.

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,170
We translate this question,
"What color is this pixel?", into math.

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,438
This equation is called
the "rendering equation."

24
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:18,039
It's a mathematical description of how
light bounces around in the environment.

25
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,709
I know we said "color."
And this equation is about light.

26
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,509
But there's a good reason for that.

27
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,759
Color is light – just light
+of different wavelengths.

28
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,450
So when we ask the question,
"What color is this pixel?",

29
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,218
we're really asking "What light is coming
through this pixel towards the camera?"

30
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:41,599
The solution to the equation
will be the answer to our question.

31
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,509
"This pixel is – purple?"
[Asks in an unsure way.]

32
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,090
To render a movie like "Up,"
we have to ask this question:

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,880
"What color is this pixel?"
billions and billions of times.

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,259
But just like every part of this process,
each little calculation isn't hard to do.

35
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,459
It's the layer upon layer
of calculation that makes it complex,

36
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:07,000
but also makes it possible to bring
something this beautiful to the screen. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
