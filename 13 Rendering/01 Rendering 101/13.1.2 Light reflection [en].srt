PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,532
- In the previous video

3
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:06,541
we saw that the basic job of a ray tracer

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,039
is to determine what color to paint each pixel.

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,913
And it does that by casting a mathematical ray

6
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,457
that starts at the camera,

7
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:16,723
passes through a pixel,

8
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:18,497
and then off into the scene.

9
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:20,157
The ray tracer must then compute

10
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:22,655
the closest intersection point

11
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,137
between the ray and the scene geometry,

12
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:26,264
and return that geometry's color.

13
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:28,112
In this video,

14
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,795
we're gonna look at how we determine

15
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:31,791
how much light is travelling along the ray

16
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:32,311
back towards camera.

17
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:34,525
That's what we need to figure out

18
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:36,620
in order to determine each pixel's color.

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,708
This is actually a pretty deep and complicated question

20
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,803
that is mathematically governed by the rendering equation.

21
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:45,328
I know it looks scary.

22
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:45,328
I mean believe me,

23
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,250
this equation still gives me nightmares.

24
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,140
But it's actually easy

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,649
if you break it down into a few pieces.

26
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,616
The amount of light travelling from a point

27
00:00:53,616 --> 00:00:55,477
on a surface back to the camera

28
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:56,659
depends on three things.

29
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,477
One, how much light is falling on that point?

30
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:04,438
Two. how does the surface of the object

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,258
at that point reflect light?

32
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,846
And three, where is the camera?

33
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,030
Let's examine each of these factors in turn

34
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,927
using some props.

35
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,941
My scene consists of a tennis ball

36
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,405
and a light source.

37
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:19,111
Now, the first factor is

38
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,304
how much light is falling on a spot

39
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,976
on that tennis ball?

40
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:25,599
It's pretty obvious that the farther away the light,

41
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,256
the lower the intensity of light

42
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,590
falling on the ball.

43
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,901
So, we need to know the distance to the light source

44
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,246
and we need to know how bright the light is.

45
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,834
It's less obvious that we need to take into account

46
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,518
the orientation of the surface

47
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:39,411
when determining how much light falls on the point.

48
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:43,516
Grazing angles receive less light or energy,

49
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:45,581
so they appear less bright.

50
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,264
Whereas the point will be brighter or hotter

51
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,028
if the surface is oriented perpendicular

52
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:51,965
to the direction of the light.

53
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,666
You feel this every sunny day.

54
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,209
It's why it's hottest at noon

55
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,892
and cooler in the morning and evening.

56
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,458
If there is more than one light source,

57
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,141
we repeat the process for each one of them.

58
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,893
The second factor is

59
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:06,633
how does the surface reflect light?

60
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,188
The color of an object is a big part

61
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:10,012
of how it responds to light.

62
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:12,461
But it's not the only factor.

63
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:15,865
Some objects have a fuzzy or dull appearance

64
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:16,617
like the tennis ball.

65
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:20,317
Others are shiny and display bright highlights

66
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,144
like this pool ball.

67
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,663
These two objects are receiving the same amount of light,

68
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:26,052
but they look very different.

69
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:29,060
Other surfaces are somewhere

70
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,906
in between dull and shiny

71
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:34,109
like human skin, wood, or even hair.

72
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:37,419
Dull surfaces are said to be diffuse

73
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,468
and shiny surfaces are said to be specular.

74
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:44,292
Finally, the last factor is

75
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,020
where is the camera?

76
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,791
Watch the middle of the number 3 on the pool ball.

77
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,212
Notice that as we move around,

78
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,372
the brightness of that point changes.

79
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:55,693
Even though everything else is the same

80
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:58,804
the only thing changing is the location of the camera.

81
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,144
Let's look at a virtual version of this physical situation.

82
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:05,628
There are three sliders that you can control.

83
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,776
Spotlight intensity which is like controlling

84
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,238
the brightness of the flashlight.

85
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:12,209
A diffuse slider which controls

86
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,449
the dullness of the surface or roughness.

87
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,513
And specular slider which controls the shininess.

88
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:21,405
You can also move the spotlight around

89
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,144
which is represented by a white dot.

90
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:26,066
For every object in a Pixar movie

91
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,568
there's a shader packet.

92
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:31,474
The shader packet describes in visual detail

93
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:32,573
everything about a surface.

94
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,221
It will include photographs of what something

95
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:36,603
looks like in real life.

96
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:38,538
Drawings describing may be the way

97
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:40,313
the roughness on a surface looks

98
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:41,119
or how someone's hair should look.

99
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,460
In this next exercise,

100
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,167
you can sit in the seat of an artist

101
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,798
using tools based on these concepts

102
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:47,645
we just covered.

103
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,091
Your job as a Pixar artist

104
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,098
is to match the reference art.

105
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,000
Have fun. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
