00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:04,737
- In the first few videos, we discussed

3
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:06,739
the basic job of a ray tracer:

4
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,119
determine the final pixel color

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,916
for each pixel in an image.

6
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,836
Let's look at a "real-world" example

7
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:15,690
from Monster's University.

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,807
First, for each pixel, we need to find

9
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:19,922
the intersection point between a ray,

10
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:22,767
starting at the camera, shooting through a pixel,

11
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,923
and shooting into the scene.

12
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:26,196
The next step is to ask,

13
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:28,955
"What color is each of these surfaces?"

14
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,481
It turns out that color, alone

15
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,662
isn't very interesting to look at, right?

16
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:35,421
Next, we need to determine how

17
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:37,233
the surface will respond to light.

18
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,659
As we discussed earlier, the two basic components

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,793
of surface response are called diffuse and specular.

20
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,801
This is a picture of how diffuse, or dull, each object is.

21
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:49,758
Where this image is bright white

22
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,261
is gonna be where the dullest surface in the scene is.

23
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,488
For example, the hat is really dull.

24
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,125
And this is a picture of how specular,

25
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,793
or shiny, each object is.

26
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,526
Now, from this image, can you tell

27
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:05,111
where the main light source is?

28
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:08,800
Pause the video now, if you need some more time.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,090
The light source is off to the left side of the screen.

30
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,066
You can actually see it reflected in Mike's eye, here.

31
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:18,270
Now, each object in the scene receives directing lighting,

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,322
which we see here in these images of diffuse and specular.

33
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,831
But they also received indirect lighting,

34
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:27,767
which is light bouncing off of other objects in the scene.

35
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:31,325
So what happens when we put all these calculations together?

36
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:41,831
It's kind of magical, right?

37
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,958
That's what we do.

38
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,000
It's math, but used to create magic! aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
