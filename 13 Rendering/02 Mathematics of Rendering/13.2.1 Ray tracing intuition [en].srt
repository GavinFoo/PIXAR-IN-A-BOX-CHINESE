00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,758
(introductory sound)

3
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:05,162
We saw in the previous lesson

4
00:00:05,162 --> 00:00:06,373
that to write a ray tracer,

5
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,649
you need a mathematical way

6
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,535
to answer a bunch of questions.

7
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:12,869
Where does a ray intersect a scene object?

8
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,435
Does a shadow ray reach the light source

9
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:17,924
before it intersects another object?

10
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:20,195
How does the surface reflect light?

11
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,408
How far away is the light source?

12
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,809
Finally, where is the camera?

13
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,361
In the remainder of this lesson,

14
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,500
we're going to focus on the first sub-problem,

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,770
that of ray object intersection.

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,073
We're going to start our study

17
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:38,917
by first looking at the simpler problem

18
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:41,110
of how to do ray object intersection

19
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,561
in two dimensions.

20
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,020
What does ray tracing look like in two dimensions?

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,489
Let's start with our three-dimensional situation

22
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,956
and take a cross-section through this white plane

23
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:54,581
that contains the camera and the viewing direction.

24
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,043
Notice too that the white plane

25
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:58,058
intersects the image plane on the line,

26
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,569
which we'll call the image line.

27
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:02,635
That means if we draw just what's in the white plane,

28
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,391
we get a picture like this.

29
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:07,257
To make the problem even easier,

30
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:08,684
we'll try first intersecting

31
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:10,366
with the simplest object possible,

32
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:12,242
the line segment.

33
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:14,037
Here's our scene:

34
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:17,851
Just a line segment connecting two points, A and B.

35
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,203
To render the scene,

36
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:21,116
just as in three dimensions,

37
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:23,857
we need to pick a location for our camera.

38
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,887
Call the camera point, C.

39
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:32,162
Next, we pick a viewing direction, shown here in red.

40
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,355
In three dimensions,

41
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:35,018
the camera location and viewing direction

42
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:37,401
defines an image plane.

43
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:41,578
but in two dimensions, it gives us an image line.

44
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,675
That's the line in which our image will be formed.

45
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,727
Now, let's pick a point, P, on the image line

46
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:52,312
to denote the pixel we want to determine the color of.

47
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:57,327
Recall that the ray tracer builds a ray from C through P

48
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,531
off into the scene.

49
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:03,363
We need a mathematical way to compute intersection points.

50
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:06,383
Like this one, called 'I'.

51
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:08,050
To develop the math,

52
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,547
we first introduce a coordinate system.

53
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:14,119
The math we need comes from looking at the Algebra

54
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:17,675
of intersecting a ray with a line segment.

55
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:19,712
We've introduced quite a few ideas in this video.

56
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:21,031
So, use the next exercise

57
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,259
to make sure you're comfortable

58
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,000
with two-dimensional ray tracing. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
