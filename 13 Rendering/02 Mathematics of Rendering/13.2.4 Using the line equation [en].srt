00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,381
- There's a detail that we need to attend to:

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,702
there's a slight problem with the slope intercept form

4
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:09,433
of the sine geometry.

5
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:11,395
The problem is that if AB is vertical,

6
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:13,856
the slope isn't defined.

7
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:16,426
To see that, look at the slope intercept form

8
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:20,237
in general: y equals m x plus i,

9
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:24,187
where m is the slope and i is the y-intercept.

10
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:29,462
The slope m is the change in y divided by the change in x,

11
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,873
meaning that if AB is a vertical line,

12
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:34,079
there is no change in x.

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,818
So, computing the slope would mean dividing by zero,

14
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:39,568
which is bad.

15
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:43,972
(bell)

16
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:45,900
But we can eliminate this problem

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,847
by multiplying through by the change in x.

18
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:52,773
So, multiplying through by the change in x,

19
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:55,801
we get change in x times y

20
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,810
equals change in y times x

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,072
plus i times change in x.

22
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:04,278
It's common to move everything to one side

23
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:08,179
and re-write this as change in y times x

24
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,440
minus change in x times y

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,631
plus i times change of x equals zero.

26
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:19,915
Call this term, change in y, a value: a;

27
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:24,420
this term, negative change in x, a value: b;

28
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,935
and this term, i times change of x, a value: c;

29
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:33,676
meaning we can write an equation for the line

30
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:38,143
as a x plus b y plus c equals zero.

31
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:42,054
An equation like this for a line goes by several names.

32
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:44,031
It is sometimes called the line equation.

33
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:46,653
It's also called the implicit form for the line.

34
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:50,436
Let's do an example for this specific line, AB.

35
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,879
Change in y is negative three.

36
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,860
Change in x is one,

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,170
and i is 11.

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,874
So, negative three x minus y

39
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:05,217
plus 11 equals zero.

40
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:08,886
That line equation is shown here.

41
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:12,300
Notice that as I move A and B around,

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,645
the line equation updates accordingly.

43
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:18,128
The line equation can be used with the parametric form

44
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:21,646
of array to compute intersection points,

45
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:25,848
this time, for any type of line, even vertical ones.

46
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,441
Use the next exercise to practice

47
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:30,000
