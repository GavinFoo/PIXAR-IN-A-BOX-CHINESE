00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,470
- Now that you have a feel for how t works,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,050
we're ready to calculate our intersection point I

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,600
between our ray CP and our line segment AB.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,260
Recall from the previous video that

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,440
the slope intercept form of the line AB

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,540
is y equals negative three x plus 11

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,400
and the parametric representation of the ray CP

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,190
is the function R of t equals one minus t

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,751
times C plus t times P.

11
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:31,820
Different values of the parameter t

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,310
locate different points on the ray.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,210
The intersection point that we're after

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,590
is one such point on the ray so there

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,510
must be some value of t, call it t star,

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,070
such that I equals R of t star.

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,140
This is really two equations, one for the x-coordinate

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,060
of I and one for the y-coordinate.

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,540
These two equations are I sub x equals R sub x

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,800
of t star, which equals one minus t star

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,110
times C sub x plus t star times P sub x.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,560
In the same way I sub y equals R sub y of t star,

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,790
which equals one minus t star times C sub y

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,150
plus t star times P sub y.

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,300
In this particular case C, our camera position,

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,700
has coordinates zero, zero

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,110
and P has coordinates two, 1/2.

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,051
So we have I sub x equals t star times two

29
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:41,940
and I sub y equals t star times 1/2.

30
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,520
I is also on the line segment AB meaning that

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,101
I satisfies the slope intercept form for AB,

32
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:53,790
that is I sub y equals negative three

33
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,880
times I sub x plus 11.

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,200
So we have three equations and three unknowns,

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,010
I sub x, I sub y and t star.

36
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,000
We can solve the system of equations

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,169
by substituting the first two equations

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,470
into the third to get an equation just in t star.

39
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,509
1/2 t star equals negative three

40
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,710
times two times t star plus 11.

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,740
Solve this for t star, then plug that value

42
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,990
of t star into the first two equations

43
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,310
to get I sub x and I sub y.

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,860
And that's how it's done.

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,342
Before we continue get some experience using this

46
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:39,000
kind of parametric function in the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
