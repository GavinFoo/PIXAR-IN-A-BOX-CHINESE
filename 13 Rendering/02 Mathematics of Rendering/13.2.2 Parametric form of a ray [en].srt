00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:05,900
- Recall that to figure out where a two-dimensional ray

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,037
intersects a line segment, we started by

4
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:11,514
first introducing a coordinate system.

5
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:13,227
Once we have our coordinate system,

6
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:16,342
we can write our line AB in slope intercept form.

7
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:24,894
Since in this example A has coordinates three two,

8
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:28,093
and B has coordinates four negative one,

9
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:30,531
the slope intercept form of AB

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,912
is y equals negative three x plus 11.

11
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:40,974
Similarly, if I pick P to have coordinates two, one half,

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,015
then the slope intercept form of the ray CP

13
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:48,351
is y equals one quarter x.

14
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:52,136
The point I we're looking for is on both of these lines.

15
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:57,175
So if I sub x and I sub y represent the coordinates of I,

16
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:02,254
then I sub y equals negative three I sub x plus eleven,

17
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:05,104
because I lies on AB.

18
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:09,260
And I sub y equals one quarter I sub x,

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,393
because I lies on the ray CP.

20
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:15,901
Solving these two equations for the two unknowns

21
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,311
gives us the coordinates I sub x and I sub y.

22
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,420
Using the slope intercept form

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,324
of the ray works in two dimensions,

24
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,623
and is fairly simple to understand, but there's a problem

25
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:28,875
when we generalize it to three dimensions.

26
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,686
The problem is that in three dimensions,

27
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:33,239
the ray doesn't have a slope intercept form.

28
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,282
So we'll have to throw out this representation of our ray

29
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:40,995
in preparation for three dimensional raytracing.

30
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:43,468
To represent our ray CP, we'll use

31
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:46,348
something called a parametric function.

32
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:49,203
What I'm about to write looks a little strange at first,

33
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:51,084
but bear with me, these functions start to

34
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,778
become familiar with practice.

35
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:57,771
My ray will be represented by a new function, R of t,

36
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:00,558
that is the weighted average of C and P,

37
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:03,489
where t is the weight.

38
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:10,829
In particular, I'm going to write R of t

39
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:15,261
as one minus t times C, plus t times P.

40
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,069
Notice what happens when t equals zero.

41
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,503
One minus t is just one. So R of zero is C.

42
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:29,442
And when t equals one, R of one equals P.

43
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,877
That's convenient, because I can relabel C as R of zero,

44
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:38,627
and I can relabel P as R of one.

45
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:43,639
R of one half would be exactly halfway between C and P.

46
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,032
Values of t greater than one name points

47
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:52,390
on the ray off in the scene beyond P.

48
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,411
Before we continue, get some experience

49
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,000
using this kind of parametric function in the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
