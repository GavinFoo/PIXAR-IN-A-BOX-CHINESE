00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:05,346
- In the previous video, we saw how to compute

3
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:07,598
an intersection point, I, that lies in the plane

4
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:09,386
of a triangle.

5
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,882
But how can we tell if the point is like this one,

6
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:15,470
that's inside the triangle; or like this one,

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,314
that's outside the triangle?

8
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:20,567
The method our ray tracer actually uses makes use

9
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,320
of vector algebra.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,619
But a method that is essentially the same is easy

11
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,576
to explain if you understand weighted averages.

12
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,293
(bell)

13
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,708
Notice that as I change the weights in the average,

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,831
the intersection point, I, moves.

15
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,082
And if all the weights are positive,

16
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,591
I is inside the triangle.

17
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:43,717
But look what happens when one

18
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:45,958
or more weights is negative:

19
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,175
I escapes from the triangle.

20
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:49,476
Bingo!

21
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:52,471
If we can determine the weights needed to produce I,

22
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,060
we can simply check their signs.

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,231
If one or two of them is negative,

24
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:59,262
I is outside the triangle,

25
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:02,140
and otherwise, I is inside.

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,404
But how can we determine the weights?

27
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:07,367
Let's leave them as unknowns for the moment,

28
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,697
and we'll call them little a, little b, and little c.

29
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:16,033
Every point I in the plane of big A, big B, and big C

30
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,084
can be written as a weighted average

31
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:22,298
of big A, big B, and big C.

32
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,921
If I pick little a, little b, and little c,

33
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,581
so that they add to one,

34
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:30,471
then I can forget about the denominator.

35
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,422
The resulting equation,

36
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:36,172
I equals little a times big A

37
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:38,438
plus little b times big B

38
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:40,771
plus little c times big C

39
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,441
represents the following three equations:

40
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,031
one for the x-coordinate,

41
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,402
one for the y-coordinate,

42
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,527
and one for the z.

43
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:52,614
We know I, big A, big B, and big C,

44
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:57,117
so the only unknowns are little a, little b, and little c.

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,672
So this is three equations and three unknowns

46
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:02,215
that can be solved for the values of little a,

47
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:04,885
little b, and little c.

48
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,544
Once you know little a, little b, and little c,

49
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,175
check their signs to determine if I is inside the triangle.

50
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,104
In this final exercise, you'll be asked

51
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,146
to compute intersection points I,

52
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:19,816
and determine if they lie inside or outside the triangle.

53
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, after all that, go forth and write your own ray tracer. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
