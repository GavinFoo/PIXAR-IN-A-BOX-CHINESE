PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,169
- I remember, when I was a kid,

3
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,032
I used to, like, run
out of shoe to draw on.

4
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:07,775
And I would just, like,
continue drawing up my leg

5
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,111
and just, like, just continue drawing.

6
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:13,565
And, you know, my dad
didn't really want me

7
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:16,186
to do too much art stuff.

8
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:18,666
He was like, "Oh, maybe
you should try architecture

9
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,418
or something like that."

10
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:23,382
And, I had to, kind of, prove to him

11
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:28,950
that there was money, that I
could make a living from art.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,368
And, what I found out early on was that,

13
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,784
when you combine art with technology,

14
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,572
which kind of made it more relevant

15
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,808
to the world that we live in today,

16
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,794
that there was a lot more job stability.

17
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:41,831
You know, stuff like that.

18
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:44,126
And, so, when I was making websites,

19
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,686
there was, like, animations.

20
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:47,823
You could, like, click on a button

21
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:49,700
and it would make a little animation.

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,199
And I was like, "Oh, what's
this animation thing?"

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,494
And then I got more and more curious

24
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:57,685
and then, as my websites
got fancier and fancier,

25
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,407
there was like, "Oh, what if
I could, like, make a logo

26
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,619
and it was, like, spinning in 3D.

27
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,626
Like, how do I make stuff in 3D?"

28
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:09,431
I went to this thing, called
the National Portfolio Day,

29
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:11,340
which is where all the
art schools, kind of,

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,251
look at students' portfolios.

31
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,813
And I had some 3D stuff

32
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:17,639
but I didn't really, I was
just like, "I'm an artist

33
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:21,194
and I happen to have some of
this stuff in my portfolio."

34
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,491
And, then, when a University saw it,

35
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,318
they were like, "Whoa."

36
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,309
They were like, "You need to do 3D."

37
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,834
And I was like, "3D what?"

38
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,292
And they were like, "No,
3D computer animation."

39
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,385
I didn't know too much technology stuff,

40
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,482
so, like, University was like, just,

41
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:37,325
I was like a sponge

42
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:41,742
and, yeah, I learned a lot in University.

43
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,226
At school, we had to come up

44
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:45,562
with a two and a half minute short film.

45
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,875
And mine was about a lighthouse keeper

46
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,714
that, the mechanism that
he turns on his light,

47
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:55,294
it needs repair because it's frozen.

48
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,042
And, so, this boat is gunna come crashing

49
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:00,230
into the reef that he's on.

50
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,974
And, so, in trying to fix the thing,

51
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:05,920
he electrocutes himself and dies.

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,014
And he pops up as a ghost

53
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:11,121
and he's trying to fix the switch

54
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,889
but he's, like, going though the switch

55
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,717
because now he's a ghost.

56
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,709
And he turns around,

57
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,943
the boat blows his horn.

58
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:22,377
He turns around, sees his dead
body, and is in crazy shock.

59
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,958
He needs to snap out of it really quickly

60
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,069
because, if he doesn't,
the boat's gunna crash.

61
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,670
And, so, what he realizes is that

62
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,934
he can go inside of the lens
that amplifies the light.

63
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,574
And, so, the ghost jumps into the lens

64
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,399
and it explodes in light.

65
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:43,405
And, finally, the boat can see the rocks

66
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:44,991
and, sort of, avoids them.

67
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,224
But there was, I think,
some golden nuggets,

68
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:48,883
sort of, inside of there.

69
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,967
I think my character, that I made,

70
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,181
I had a lot of fun making it.

71
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,764
And, when I applied to Pixar,

72
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:58,852
I was applying for a
different job position

73
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:02,367
and I happened to have a little video

74
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,049
of my character, kind
of like, moving around

75
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,037
and having all these,
like, facial expressions.

76
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,738
And they were like, "We
want you for rigging."

77
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:12,161
And I was like, "What's rigging?"

78
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,949
(laughs)

79
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,767
And, so, rigging, also
known as reticulation,

80
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:22,279
is, basically, designing an
interface of a bunch of, like,

81
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:25,468
knobs that when you,
like, move them around

82
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:29,450
it's, like, moving the character,
and blinking the eyelid

83
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,688
and stuff like that.

84
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,067
(laughs)

85
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,119
I love making robots

86
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:38,491
and I love making robots because

87
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:42,209
it's a continuation of
what I love here at Pixar.

88
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,114
Which is making these characters that,

89
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:49,259
hopefully, in the minds
of people, they're alive.

90
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,592
And, for me, robotics is just like ,

91
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:57,590
"What if I couldn't make
characters seem alive

92
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,662
for just two hours?

93
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:03,420
What if I could just make them
seem alive for a lot longer?

94
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,573
Like, hopefully, many years."

95
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:08,539
And, so, yeah, it's exciting,

96
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,217
just, you know, tinkering
with a bunch of things

97
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,334
that I don't know about

98
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:16,382
because it's literally, I
came from an art background.

99
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,043
And, so, it's mechanical engineering,

100
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:24,870
electrical engineering,
computer science, fabrication.

101
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,125
There's so many things
that I just don't know.

102
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,666
And, literally, just
looking on the internet.

103
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,660
Like, I haven't taken a single class

104
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,235
because I'm such a visual learner.

105
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:38,122
I always, you know,
search on YouTube first.

106
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:41,697
For me, like, videos are what help me.

107
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:46,077
And, text, I only resort to text
when there isn't any video stuff.

108
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:50,940
And, so it's just, kind of, an experiment

109
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,127
with robots and humans and the kind of

110
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,134
interactions that you can have

111
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:01,059
with, kind of, an artifical being.

112
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,000
Just, pretty cool. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
