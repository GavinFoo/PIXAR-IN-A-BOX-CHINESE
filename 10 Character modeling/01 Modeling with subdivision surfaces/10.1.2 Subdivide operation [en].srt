00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,273
- One of the cool things about
splitting and averaging is

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,589
that it's pretty easy to program.

4
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:10,416
So, you just need to find the midpoint,

5
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,899
which is just averaging coordinates.

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,219
This makes it pretty easy

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,844
for the people that write our software

8
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:21,978
to create intuitive tools for artists,

9
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,394
like myself, to create characters.

10
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:26,504
Kinda like you used on the smiley face.

11
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,027
In this next version of the interactive,

12
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:32,055
we've replaced the split
and average buttons

13
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,459
with a single button, called "Subdivide".

14
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:39,685
Clicking it simply does
split followed by average.

15
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,996
Focus your attention on
this region of the curve.

16
00:00:44,996 --> 00:00:46,276
Now, let's extend these lines

17
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,239
until they hit the control polygon.

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,594
Hmm. Doesn't this look, suspiciously,

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,958
like the string art construction

20
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,311
we saw in the parabolic arcs?

21
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,656
Now, watch what happens
when I subdivide again.

22
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:07,687
The string art pattern
continues to emerge.

23
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,515
Now, every time you hit subdivide,

24
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,318
you get twice as many strings.

25
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:14,843
And that means that the curve

26
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:18,637
that we're creating is a
parabolic arc in this region.

27
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:21,669
And there's another
parabolic arc over here

28
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,127
and over here and over here.

29
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,605
But, magically, these
four arcs are smoothly

30
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,552
blending from one to another.

31
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:32,925
I think that's just so cool.

32
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,549
As someone interested in mathematics,

33
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,137
this is the kind of surprise
that I find exciting.

34
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:41,681
This next exercise will test

35
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,000
how well you understand this concept. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
