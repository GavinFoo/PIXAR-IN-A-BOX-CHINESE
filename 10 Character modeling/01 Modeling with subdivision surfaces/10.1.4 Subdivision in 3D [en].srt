00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:05,053
- So far, in this lesson, we've learned

3
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:07,731
how to model curves in two dimensions.

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,068
And, now, it's time to go back to the real problem

5
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,891
that we wanna address:
how to model the fun part,

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,564
characters, using surfaces in three dimensions.

7
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,180
And that is where subdivision really shines.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,968
The same ideas of splitting

9
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:26,893
and averaging still apply in three dimensions.

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,530
And that means that subdivision applies as well.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,659
For example, suppose that I start with a cube.

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,508
I can look at the cube from different angles

13
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:38,494
by clicking on the background and dragging.

14
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:39,552
The splitting step is a little bit

15
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,517
more complicated than for curves.

16
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:46,145
In addition to adding new midpoints of edges, like this one,

17
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:50,787
I also need to add midpoints of the facets, like this one.

18
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,189
Midpoints of facets are computed

19
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,444
by averaging all of the coordinates

20
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:57,450
of the control points surrounding that facet.

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,991
For instance, this midpoint is computed

22
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:02,809
as the average of these four points.

23
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,568
And this one, is the average of these four points.

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,048
The averaging step is a little bit more complicated

25
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:11,262
than the curve case, too.

26
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:15,107
Each point is, again, repositioned using averaging,

27
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:17,870
but, now, it isn't a straight average.

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,389
We need to use the weighted average of all of the points

29
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:22,936
next to the one that we are repositioning.

30
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:29,486
We'll talk more about weighted averages in the next lesson.

31
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,477
And, just like the curves, we can combine

32
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:35,175
split and average into a subdivide operation.

33
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,043
And, if we subdivide it enough times,

34
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:40,555
the shape becomes a smooth surface.

35
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:44,643
Now, let's try this on a doughnut shape.

36
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:47,427
Subdividing once gives me this.

37
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:50,149
Subdividing again gives me that.

38
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,093
In practice, we subdivide as many times as we need to,

39
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,751
to create a smooth image.

40
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,559
Subdivision was first used to create

41
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:01,287
the character named Geri,

42
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,517
from the short film called "Geri's game".

43
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:07,941
Here's Geri's hand before the subdivision.

44
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,992
And here it is after subdivision.

45
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:13,329
Since "Geri's game", we've used subdivision

46
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,396
to create practically all of our characters.

47
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:19,931
We even used subdivision for things besides characters,

48
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,817
like the buildings in "The Incredibles",

49
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:26,099
because subdivision surfaces are so easy for artists to use.

50
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,816
Next up, we have a simplified 3D program

51
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,124
for you to play with.

52
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:32,124
Really.

53
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:34,865
Go play!

54
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:38,157
Try anything and everything you can think of.

55
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,037
You can't break it and you can always restart.

56
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,562
Once you start to feel comfortable

57
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,735
with how the subdivision operation behaves,

58
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:48,782
move on and we'll try the final exercise.

59
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,651
After that, you can check out the next lesson,

60
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:54,715
which goes a bit deeper into the mathematics of subdivision.

61
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,000
