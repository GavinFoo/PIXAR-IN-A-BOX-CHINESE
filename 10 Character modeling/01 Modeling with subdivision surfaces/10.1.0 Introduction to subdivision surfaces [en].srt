PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:03,855
 My name is Tony DeRose and I am a computer scientist at Pixarze. 

3
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,909
 The film's look and move differently, 

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,058
 but they do not seem drawings computer. 

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:14,197
 They appear to be plausible naturally. 

6
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:17,450
 The first stage of creating the appearance of a modeling. 

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,450
 We are not talking about such models ... 

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,405
 Only with such modeling! 

9
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:25,021
 You need to create a virtual computer in three-dimensional form. 

10
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,001
 To figure was credible, 

11
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,127
 should have a gentle outline. 

12
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:34,865
 No matter how close to the camera is located. 

13
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:38,913
 The easiest forms are simple: plane or cylinder. 

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,511
 We have to do more complicated bodies. 

15
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:43,440
 The problem seems difficult, 

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,946
 but divided it in two simple steps, easy to make on your computer. 

17
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:50,033
 We use an algorithm subdivision (division) 

18
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,963
 to obtain a gentle outline. I explain. 

19
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:56,381
 A simple example in two dimensions. 

20
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,329
 Four sections defined by four points. 

21
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,656
 First, I'll measures episodes. 

22
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,655
 This stage of the split (division). 

23
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:06,824
 Shape becomes milder, 

24
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:11,430
 when I move every point about 1/2 the distance from a neighbor. I will combine eight points. 

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,388
 It averaging (centering). At least, that's something, 

26
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:19,584
 but the effect will be better when repeat. Sharing and centering. And again. 

27
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:22,383
 I combine these two steps 

28
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:26,608
 in one step called subdivision (division). It will be even easier. 

29
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:31,587
 Super: You can animate the entire curve, 

30
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:34,187
 moving the original 4 points. 

31
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,943
 Our characters are figures in 2D. 

32
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:39,551
 They are three-dimensional. 

33
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:43,988
 Also here, the principle of sharing and centering. 

34
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:47,608
 Animation requires only a few points. 

35
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,492
 We solved the complex problem of creating the curve, 

36
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:53,000
 dividing it into stages, which we realize mathematically.  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
