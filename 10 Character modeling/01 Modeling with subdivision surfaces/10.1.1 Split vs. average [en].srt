PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:03,232
- Hi. I'm Alonso Martinez and I'm a Character modeler

3
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:04,963
here at Pixar Animation Studios,

4
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,074
and that means that I create the virtual characters

5
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,314
that the animators use to bring our characters to life.

6
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:13,472
And if I do my job right that means that

7
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,318
not only will people believe that they're real,

8
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:19,774
but also they'll become personal friends.

9
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,373
Right now I'm standing at the Pixar Art Gallery

10
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:24,618
and this place is dedicated to celebrate

11
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:26,139
all of the hard work

12
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:28,793
that goes into making these movies great.

13
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:32,451
It's important for all departments here at Pixar

14
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:34,340
to help with the story telling.

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,601
And for the character department,

16
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,203
when we design our characters,

17
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,948
we tell story through the shapes of our characters.

18
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,803
One of my favorite examples is from the movie Up,

19
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:47,341
and that's because Carl is designed like a box

20
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:51,139
and that's because he's jailed in with all of the emotions

21
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:53,863
from the hard times that he's had in life.

22
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:56,967
But Russell is shaped like an egg.

23
00:00:56,967 --> 00:01:00,926
Both of these are symbols for who these characters are.

24
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:03,142
To create great characters like these,

25
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,263
we need to make tools that are easy

26
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:06,784
for artists to create those shapes

27
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,665
that we were talking about.

28
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:11,540
And also, at the same time, for them to be efficient

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,001
for the computer to be able to deal with all of that data.

30
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,453
And that's the topic for this lesson.

31
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,229
Stick around for more.

32
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,808
In the Environment Modeling Lesson

33
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:26,965
we saw how to describe blades of grass using parabolas,

34
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:29,381
but parabolas are just not good enough

35
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,619
to describe the expressiveness of characters.

36
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,242
For example, here's a sculpture of Geri's hand

37
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:38,465
from Geri's Game.

38
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,581
To describe complex surfaces like this,

39
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,602
that's where subdivision comes in.

40
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,087
And as we saw in the previous video,

41
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:48,239
subdivision is extremely expressive.

42
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,185
In the first part of the lesson

43
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,932
we'll be looking more closely at how subdivision

44
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,910
can be used to create complex shapes.

45
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,383
And then in part two, we'll dive more deeply

46
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,482
into the mathematics of subdivision.

47
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:02,578
Most of the mathematics we use here at Pixar

48
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,605
have been around for hundreds or thousands of years,

49
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:07,042
but subdivision is different.

50
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,398
It was actually only invented about 40 years ago

51
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:13,880
and is still an active area of mathematical research.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,025
The skins of our characters live in three dimensional space,

53
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:19,126
but for now, we're going to look at curves

54
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,181
in two dimensions.

55
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,980
Starting with a four-point polygon,

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,956
we add more points by Splitting,

57
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:28,402
that is, by adding mid-points to the edges.

58
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:31,781
I can make it smoother by moving each point

59
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,198
from where it is now,

60
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:36,126
to the mid-point of its right neighbor.

61
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:39,104
We call this, the Averaging step.

62
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:43,092
By repeatedly Splitting and Averaging,

63
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:47,394
we create a series of increasingly smoother curves.

64
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,598
Now, imagine that you're an artist at Pixar

65
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,208
and you've been asked to create a shape like this one.

66
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,601
Using this next interactive,

67
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,000
see how close you can get. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
