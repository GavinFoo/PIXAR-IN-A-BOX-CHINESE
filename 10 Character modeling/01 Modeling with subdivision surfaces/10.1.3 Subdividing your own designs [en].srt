00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,195
- So far, we've been doing subdivisions

3
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:08,304
with just four points, which make a blob.

4
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:09,563
But, if you're gunna make something

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,188
as cool as a Pixar character,

6
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:13,241
you're gunna need a lot more points.

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,472
For example, suppose that I wanna model

8
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:20,570
the outline of a hand or, maybe, the profile of a character.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,623
Fortunately, subdivision doesn't care

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,082
how many points you start out with.

11
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,356
In this interactive, you can move points, as before,

12
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:32,075
but you can also add as many new points as you'd like.

13
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,712
Just click on an interior of an edge to create a new point.

14
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:36,647
And, then, use the mouse

15
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,587
to drag the new point wherever you want it.

16
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:43,342
I can make a crude looking hand shaped like this.

17
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,597
Use this slider to control how many subdivisions

18
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:50,330
are used to give a smoother result.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,456
Using this interactive, make a hand or whatever you'd like.

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,376
Maybe, a dinosaur, or the outline of Mike Wazowski,

21
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:01,982
or whatever interests you.

22
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:03,000
