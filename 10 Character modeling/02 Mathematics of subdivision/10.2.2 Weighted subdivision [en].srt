 In Pixar BOX 

3
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:05,792
 You already know this and that 

4
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,042
 of the weighted average for the two and three points. 

5
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,542
 Let's see what will happen, 

6
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:15,542
 When the step of centering with the center points 

7
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,751
 We replace the weighted average. 

8
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:23,918
 Let's go back to the exercise of the division and the curve. 

9
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:27,501
 Only now we can change the weight 

10
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,918
 at the stage of centering. 

11
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:35,959
 Ones mean that draw simple average. 

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,542
 I divide the sides, as usual, by proposing their measures. 

13
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:43,792
 Now we move the points about half the distance 

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,167
 toward the right-hand neighbor. 

15
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:53,125
 Look, what if I change the weight of 2, 2 and 1. 

16
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,542
 Division 

17
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:00,082
 centering 

18
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:06,751
 Generalize this to extract the average of the three points. 

19
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:12,501
 Look what happens when I change the weight at 1, 2 and 1. 

20
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,542
 Now I share, as before, 

21
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,375
 but while centering 

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,375
 each point will move to the designated place weight 2. 

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,584
 The neighbor on the left has a weight of 1 

24
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,167
 and neighbor on the right - or 1. 

25
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,918
 This point should move more or less here, 

26
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,375
 as in the example with the weighted average. 

27
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:40,125
 If we divide again and Center, the effect will be the same. 

28
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:48,000
 The exercise oswoicie with the concept of weighted divisions. Good luck!  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
