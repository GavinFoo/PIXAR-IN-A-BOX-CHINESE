- Congratulations you're in the last step of this lesson.

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,733
To finish our look at weighted averages

4
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,264
recall that if I pick weights one one

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,552
I get subdivision curves that look like this.

6
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:17,021
And we learn that these shapes are pieces of degree

7
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:21,625
two curves like Y equals X squared stitched together.

8
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,532
And if I pick the weights one-two-one,

9
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,050
I get curves that look smoother.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,349
Just like this.

11
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,288
These curves turn out to be pieces of degree three curves

12
00:00:32,288 --> 00:00:35,634
like Y equals X cubed stitched together.

13
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:40,087
In this example there are four different degree three pieces

14
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:42,518
I can even get smoother curves

15
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:45,346
by picking the weights one-three-three-one.

16
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:51,623
Which are degree four curves like Y equals X to the fourth.

17
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:56,339
And it turns out that the weights have to be chosen

18
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,704
very carefully for the curves to be smooth.

19
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,288
So what exactly does carefully mean?

20
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:08,555
These numbers one-one, one-two-one, one-three-three-one

21
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:11,880
all come from a pattern called Pascal's Triangle.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,849
Let's see what happens if I pick weights

23
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,617
that aren't from Pascal's Triangle.

24
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:23,709
I don't even have to pick positive weights,

25
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,319
so supposed I pick one-negative two-three?

26
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,440
Nothing new with split, it always just adds mid points.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,432
But when I do the averaging stuff, whoa!

28
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,654
As I keep subdividing the curve gets less and less smooth.

29
00:01:42,654 --> 00:01:45,111
It's something called a fractal.

30
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,480
We don't have all of the mathematical tools

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,034
that we require to show this,

32
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:53,309
there's some more advanced concepts from linear algebra

33
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:56,057
and something called eigenanalysis.

34
00:01:56,057 --> 00:02:00,248
Eigenanalysis sounds kinda scary but mathematicians are just

35
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:03,870
really good at coming up with names that are kinda scary.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,366
And just like we've done so far

37
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,950
you just learn one step at a time.

38
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,393
The main thing that I want you to walk away with

39
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:14,121
is that the surfaces that you see in our films

40
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,662
are actually pretty easy to create.

41
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:20,426
The art department creates sketches for the modelers

42
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:24,192
to refer to when determining control point positions.

43
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:27,359
From there the software tools do the splitting and averaging

44
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,973
to produce the beautiful surfaces

45
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,443
that you see in the theater.

46
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,768
Of course when you're watching one of our films

47
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:36,113
we don't want you to think about any of that.

48
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,686
We just want you to sit back, relax,

49
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,258
and let the movie take you away.

50
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:43,098
So play around with the weights.

51
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,640
See what weird results you can get.

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,000
And when you're done you can move onto the final exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
