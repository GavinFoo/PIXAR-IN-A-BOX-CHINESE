00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,748
- In the last lesson, we explored

3
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,933
the geometric behavior of cameras.

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,124
We saw how light bounces off objects,

5
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:11,258
passes through a small hole or aperture,

6
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:13,329
and hits an image plane.

7
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,206
One of the important concepts we covered

8
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:17,062
was depth of field,
which is a region where

9
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:19,223
objects appear in focus.

10
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:22,334
Outside that region,
objects appear blurry.

11
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,328
When a point at an image is out of focus,

12
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,955
it grows into a blurry circle

13
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:28,588
known as the circle of confusion.

14
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:30,825
In this lesson, we'll develop
the algebraic equations

15
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:34,349
which tell us exactly where
things come into focus,

16
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,369
and how big the circle
of confusion will be

17
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,470
if something isn't in focus.

18
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,241
And these equations
will allow us to create

19
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:43,009
virtual cameras to create stunning images,

20
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,476
such as this shot.

21
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:48,691
To begin, let's return
to our pinhole camera.

22
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,507
As usual, when bridging the gap

23
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,227
between geometry and algebra,

24
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:55,106
we'll need to introduce
a coordinate system.

25
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,907
It's convenient to choose
our coordinate system

26
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:00,395
so that the pinhole is at
the origin, right here.

27
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:03,786
And let's imagine that our
scene is off to the right.

28
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:05,549
Suppose the image plane inside our camera

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,045
is at some distance to
the left of the pinhole.

30
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,072
Let's call this distance i.

31
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:13,374
Now consider a point on
some object in our scene.

32
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,418
Call this point x zero, y zero.

33
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,953
When light in the
environment hits this point,

34
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,417
some of it will bounce toward the camera,

35
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:23,307
through the pinhole and
hit the image plane.

36
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:27,339
Let's call the place it hits
the image plane x one, y one.

37
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:31,307
So our first question is
what is x one and y one?

38
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,636
One way to solve this is to use

39
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,027
the slope intercept form of a line.

40
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,950
The slope of the ray
is y zero over x zero,

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,422
and the y-intercept is zero

42
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:42,311
because we said this ray
passes through the origin.

43
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,605
That is, the equation of the ray is just

44
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,607
y equals y zero over x
zero, times x, plus zero.

45
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:54,797
Or, simply, y equals y
zero over x zero, times x.

46
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:59,739
Now the point we're
looking for, x one, y one,

47
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:04,000
is also on this ray, so it must
satisfy that line equation.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,553
Meaning y one equals y zero
over x zero, times x one.

49
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,255
And notice the diagram tells
us that x one is negative

50
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:14,650
and a distance i away from the origin.

51
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,729
That is, we know x one equals minus i.

52
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,353
Finally, to get y one, we
just substitute to give us

53
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:24,407
y one equals minus y zero
over x zero, times i.

54
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:29,519
Notice that the point
was originally positive

55
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,788
but the corresponding point
on the plane is negative.

56
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:34,104
And that's the image flip.

57
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:36,526
Okay, let's pause here to give
you some experience with this

58
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:39,000
before we add a lens to our camera. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
