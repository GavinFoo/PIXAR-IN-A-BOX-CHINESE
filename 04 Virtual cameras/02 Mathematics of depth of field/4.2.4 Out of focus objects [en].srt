00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:04,763
- Welcome back.

3
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:05,925
Now that you're getting comfortable with

4
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:08,524
the simple lens law, let's go a little deeper.

5
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:11,042
In the previous exercise you found that the simple lens law

6
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:15,184
can be written as i equals o times f, divided by o minus f.

7
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,672
So if the image plane in our camera is at distance i,

8
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:21,421
objects at distance o from the camera

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,701
will come into crisp focus.

10
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:26,546
But what about objects at some other distance?

11
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:28,415
Well, they'll be blurry.

12
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:30,277
They're not in crisp focus.

13
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,891
For example, the in-focus leaves are at a distance

14
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:35,862
that satisfies the simple lens equation.

15
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:39,269
However, the objects in the background are blurred out.

16
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:42,295
And notice how the blur is in the shape of a circle.

17
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,228
Recall from the last lesson,

18
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:46,365
we called this a circle of confusion.

19
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,849
But how big is the circle?

20
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:50,036
To answer that question, in the rest of this lesson

21
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:51,670
we'll develop a formula that describes

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,300
the size of the circle, given things like the focal length

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,021
of the lens, the aperture, and the distance to the object.

24
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,883
As before, let's look at this problem in 2-D

25
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:03,164
and consider what happens to a point P

26
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,605
with coordinates x zero, y zero,

27
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,962
at a distance o from the lens.

28
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:11,022
We can intersect the parallel and medial rays

29
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:13,465
to find the point where P comes into focus.

30
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,572
Let's call this A.

31
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:17,920
And remember, every lens has an aperture,

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,711
which restricts which rays make it into the camera.

33
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:24,300
Let's put a point E at the center of our lens

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,980
and a point D at the top of the aperture.

35
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,206
In other words, DE is the radius of our aperture.

36
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:34,422
So all light rays from P which pass through DE

37
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:37,633
end up focusing at the same point A.

38
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,602
And if the image plane is at this distance i,

39
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,507
then P will be in sharp focus.

40
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:47,995
But if the image plane is at a larger distance, i prime,

41
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,739
say over here, then P's image gets blurred out,

42
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:55,286
into the region denoted BC in the diagram.

43
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,805
This distance BC defines the size

44
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,628
of the circle of confusion,

45
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:03,116
that is, BC is the radius of the blur.

46
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,821
Okay, let's pause here so you can get comfortable

47
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,000
with this diagram before we finish our calculation. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
