00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:02,227
(metal clanking)
(ball thudding)

3
00:00:02,227 --> 00:00:03,147
(bell dings)

4
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:04,439
- Great work!

5
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:06,344
Now that you know what's going on to make a sharp image,

6
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:08,287
let's calculate exactly where the point

7
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:09,780
of sharp focus is.

8
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,975
We know the point where the medial

9
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:14,441
and parallel rays intersect.

10
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,666
Again, let's put the origin of our coordinate system

11
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,538
at the center of the lens.

12
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:19,847
And let the point to be focused

13
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:23,420
have coordinates X zero and Y zero.

14
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,496
The medial ray passes through the origin

15
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:27,651
and the point X zero Y zero.

16
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,000
So the line equation for it

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,635
is just Y equals Y zero divided by X zero times X.

18
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,521
The parallel ray passes through two points we know.

19
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:41,239
The point on the lens it hits, which is at zero Y zero,

20
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,500
and the focal point of the lens, which is at minus F zero.

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,489
It has a slope Y zero over F,

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,489
and a Y-intercept at Y zero.

23
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,242
So the equation of this line

24
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:53,574
is Y equals Y zero over F

25
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:56,517
times X plus Y zero.

26
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:58,487
To intersect these lines

27
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:01,645
we set these equations equal to one another.

28
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,721
We have Y zero over X zero times X

29
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:09,256
equals Y zero over F times X plus Y zero.

30
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:11,962
Then we divide through by Y zero

31
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:15,199
to give one over X zero times X

32
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:18,186
equals one over F times X plus one.

33
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:20,746
And now let's divide through by X,

34
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,780
which give us one over X zero

35
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,648
equals one over F, plus one over X.

36
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:28,578
Notice the X in this equation is the X coordinate

37
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,169
where the lines intersect.

38
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:34,427
According to our diagram this happens when X equals minus I.

39
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,242
Our diagram also tells us that X zero

40
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,750
is equal to the object distance, O.

41
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,178
So we have one over O equals one over F minus one over I,

42
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:48,979
which we usually rewrite as one over O

43
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,509
plus one over I equals one over F.

44
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,345
Ta-da!

45
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,397
This is called the simple lens law.

46
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:58,221
It says that an object at distance O from the lens,

47
00:01:58,221 --> 00:01:59,681
with focal length F,

48
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,506
comes into focus at distance I.

49
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:03,839
In the next exercise

50
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:07,000
we'll test your understanding of this idea. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
