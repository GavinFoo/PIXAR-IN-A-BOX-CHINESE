00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,975
- Now, it's time to add a lens to our pinhole camera.

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:07,885
In the previous lesson, we explored how lenses

4
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:11,013
bend or refract incoming parallel rays of light

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:14,840
and focus them at a single point known as a focal point.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,628
We called the distance from the lens

7
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:20,042
to the focal point the focal length of the lens.

8
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:22,562
Now, if an object is really far from a lens,

9
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:23,905
all the light rays leaving it

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,755
are effectively parallel like this,

11
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,792
and these rays focus at this point,

12
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:31,145
which is distance f from the lens.

13
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,341
We saw this relationship in lesson one,

14
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:35,132
but now let's think about nearby objects.

15
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,393
Where do they focus?

16
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:38,550
That is, where would you have to put the image plane

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,784
to make this image sharp?

18
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:44,397
To get started, we need to introduce some new variables.

19
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:48,504
As we say in lesson one, f is the focal length of the lens.

20
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:52,124
Let o be the distance to the object we want to focus on,

21
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:54,610
and let i represent the distance from the lens

22
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,605
and when the object comes into focus.

23
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:58,558
Let's call this the focus plane.

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,943
So, we need to develop a formula

25
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:03,240
that lets us compute i from f and o.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,410
Before we can do this, we need to look more closely

27
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,013
at how lenses refract light.

28
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,291
Refraction is actually a little complicated,

29
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,632
and it's described by an equation called Snell's law,

30
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:15,877
but we won't need it here because we'll make an important

31
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:19,535
simplifying assumption called the thin lens approximation,

32
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:21,822
which makes the math easier to solve.

33
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:23,781
The thin lens approximation says

34
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,622
that any ray that passes through the center of the lens

35
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:27,967
doesn't get bent at all.

36
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:29,836
It remains straight.

37
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,076
These are called medial rays.

38
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:34,357
And we know that parallel rays will refract

39
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,067
as they pass through the lens

40
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,587
and pass through the focal point of the lens.

41
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:42,421
That point is at distance f from the lens on the x-axis.

42
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,108
So, the focal length efines where a parallel ray

43
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,300
crosses the x-axis.

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,898
So, now we have a definition of two rays

45
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:51,989
which leave our object, medial and parallel,

46
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,782
and where the two rays intersect

47
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:57,970
defines the distance i at which the object comes into focus.

48
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,288
And the really cool part, the thin lens approximation

49
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,012
says that all rays leaving this point

50
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:05,983
will come into focus at the same place.

51
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:09,842
And similarly, all points on the plane parallel to the lens

52
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:13,180
and at a distance o will come into focus on the same plane

53
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,800
on the other side, which is why we call it our focus plane.

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,937
If we can find the intersection

55
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,298
of those two rays, then we'll know where all rays

56
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,167
from this object will come into focus.

57
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,188
Pretty cool.

58
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,798
Okay, let's pause here so you can build your intuition

59
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:29,000
about this diagram using the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
