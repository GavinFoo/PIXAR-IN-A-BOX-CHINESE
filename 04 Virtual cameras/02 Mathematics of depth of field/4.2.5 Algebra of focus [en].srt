00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,542
- Okay, now that you're
comfortable with this diagram,

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:07,576
I think you are,

4
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:10,165
we can develop our final formula.

5
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,219
Remember, we need a formula that tells us

6
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:14,940
what BC is in terms of things we know,

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,027
like the focal length of the lens,

8
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:21,110
the size of the aperture, and
the distance to our object, P.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,782
The key to this formula is to notice that

10
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:25,870
there are similar triangles
lurking in the diagram.

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,059
To figure this out, let's
simplify our diagram

12
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,242
to show only the two
triangles we care about.

13
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:35,758
Notice the triangle ABC is
similar to the triangle AED.

14
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:38,196
That means that the length BC divided by

15
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:42,895
the length DE is equal to
the length AB divided by AE.

16
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:46,237
Let's call this Equation One.

17
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:49,228
We know what DE is, that's
the radius of the aperture.

18
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:51,982
But we don't know AB or AE.

19
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:55,435
I'm also gonna add two
new points, F and G.

20
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:57,408
This gives us two new right triangles,

21
00:00:57,408 --> 00:01:00,475
ABF and AEG, which are also similar.

22
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:05,401
This means that AB divided by
AE equals FA divided by AG.

23
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,855
But, FA is just the difference

24
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:12,894
between i and i prime,
and AG is the distance i.

25
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:18,013
So, we can rewrite this
as AB divided by AE

26
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:21,933
equals i prime minus i, divided by i.

27
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,595
And now, let's substitute
this back into Equation One,

28
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:29,501
which gives us BC divided by DE equals

29
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,443
i prime minus i, divided by i.

30
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:38,602
Finally, we just solve for
BC, which gives us our answer.

31
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:42,683
BC equals DE times i prime
minus i divided by i.

32
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,686
Ah, ha, we have an equation
for the Circle of Confusion.

33
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:50,281
(chiming)

34
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,325
If you wanted to, you
could also substitute

35
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:55,273
i and i prime from the
simple lens equation

36
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,446
to write out the radius
of the Circle of Confusion

37
00:01:57,446 --> 00:02:00,165
in terms of F, O, and O prime.

38
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll leave that for you to work
out in this final exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
