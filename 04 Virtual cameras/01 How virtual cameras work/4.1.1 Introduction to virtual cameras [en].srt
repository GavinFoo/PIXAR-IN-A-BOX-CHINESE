2
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:06,588
- Hi, I'm Patrick Lin, the
director of photography

3
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:08,225
for camera on Inside Out.

4
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,634
- And I'm Adam Habib,
camera lead on Inside Out.

5
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:13,310
This lesson is about cameras,
the art of using them,

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,750
and the science behind them.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,741
We're talking about physical cameras first

8
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,296
because the virtual cameras we use to make

9
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:20,909
our movies are modeled
after the real thing.

10
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,511
- First, let's talk about lenses.

11
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:24,624
The kind of lenses we put
in front of the camera

12
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,348
and how we adjust the amount of light

13
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:28,001
that is traveling through that lens

14
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,013
affects the image we record.

15
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:30,013
Cheese.

16
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:31,732
(camera shutter clicks)

17
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,190
- [Adam] For instance, for this selfie

18
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,855
we used a wide angle lens.

19
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:37,378
If we change out the lens for a narrower

20
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:39,771
long lens, like this 75 millimeter,

21
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,342
the picture will look very different.

22
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,497
- Smile.

23
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,314
(camera shutter clicks)

24
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:47,269
Whoa, we're barely in the shot.

25
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,922
Looks like we have moved
the camera but we haven't.

26
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:52,018
In fact, to get the
environment and ourself

27
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,718
in this shot, with this lens,

28
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,432
we have to move the camera a lot.

29
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,390
Hey, Sylvia.

30
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,524
- Hi.

31
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:00,115
- Do you mind taking a photo for us?

32
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:02,353
- Sure, were guys trying to take a selfie

33
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,842
with this long lens?

34
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:06,459
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

35
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,668
(drum roll)

36
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:15,558
(camera shutter clicks)

37
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:18,121
- Good thing they had a ladder here.

38
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,909
- [Adam] Now that the
shot is composed the same,

39
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,697
you can see what else
changes about the image

40
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,276
because of our lens choice.

41
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:26,590
For instance, notice what
is in focus or out of focus.

42
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,819
- [Patrick] In the wide angle image,

43
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,882
almost everything is in focus

44
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,771
and in the picture taken
with the long lens,

45
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:34,415
only a small part of
the image is in focus.

46
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:35,785
Another thing that changes is the

47
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:37,921
feeling of perspective in the image.

48
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,188
This means how close or far
away the objects appear.

49
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:42,408
- [Adam] In the wide angle shot,

50
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:43,552
when the camera is closer,

51
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:45,346
the nearer subjects appear a lot bigger

52
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,616
and more remote objects feel farther away.

53
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,253
- [Patrick] In the long lens shot,

54
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,349
when the camera is farther away,

55
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,673
there appears to be less distance

56
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:53,920
between the nearer and
the farther objects.

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,766
Every choice you make with the camera

58
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,367
changes the feeling of the shot

59
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,246
and our job is to makes choices

60
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:01,815
that supports the emotion of a story.

61
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:03,773
- Let's go show them how
it worked on Inside Out.

62
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:04,833
(camera shutter clicks)

63
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,364
This is the virtual camera
we use to make our movies.

64
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:09,279
It has interchangeable
lenses just like the camera

65
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,812
we used to take our selfie.

66
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:12,419
- So depending on the lens we use

67
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,703
and the placement of the camera,

68
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,990
we should see a similar
effect on the image.

69
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,324
- [Adam] Here's a shot from Inside Out

70
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:19,449
that is compositionally
a lot like our selfie.

71
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,039
Let's start with that same wide lens

72
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,122
we used for the first
selfie, the 18 millimeter.

73
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,549
It looks okay, but we
don't want to choose a lens

74
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,627
just based on what we
can fit in the frame.

75
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:31,472
We want to ask ourselves,
what is this scene about?

76
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,649
- The core of the scene is about empathy,

77
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,857
so all of our decisions in framing,

78
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:38,133
composition, staging and lens choices

79
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,346
should be guided by that idea.

80
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:42,738
- [Adam] I think I'll try
the 50 millimeter lens.

81
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,070
Using this lens, and
adjusting the depth of field,

82
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,782
which determines what's
in or out of focus,

83
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:49,553
I think we'll get the right look.

84
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:51,550
An image that focuses on the characters

85
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,312
so the background just falls away.

86
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:55,688
- There are many different feelings

87
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,049
we support through our camera choices,

88
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,181
fear, happiness, insecurity, wonder.

89
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,958
In each case, we thought about how we

90
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,050
could use the camera
to amplify the emotions

91
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,430
we wanted to achieve in that scene.

92
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,435
There is a lot of cool stuff to learn

93
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,000
so stay with us. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
