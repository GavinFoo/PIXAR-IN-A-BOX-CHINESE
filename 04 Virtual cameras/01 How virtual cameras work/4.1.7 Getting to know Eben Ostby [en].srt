PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,566
- When I started college,

3
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:07,999
computer graphics was a really primitive medium

4
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:08,832
at that point.

5
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:11,568
It was plotter graphics

6
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:14,692
and we had a device at our computer lab

7
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,079
that allowed you to draw a picture

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,617
with lines and so that's where I learned

9
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:23,104
about geometric transformations and linear algebra

10
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,587
and the things that go into CG

11
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:27,420
because we had this device

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,825
and I wanted to draw pictures on it.

13
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,554
When I started at Pixar, I got a summer job

14
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:35,386
doing what you would now call IT,

15
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:38,076
which was what we called the Systems Group.

16
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:41,121
I kept one of the four computers

17
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,009
that we had in the main computer room.

18
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,518
I helped keep it running, and in my off hours,

19
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:50,398
I got to use the CG lab that had a handful

20
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,602
of image computing devices in it.

21
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,301
Because I was really interested in that,

22
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,912
I had spent more and more time there

23
00:00:55,912 --> 00:01:00,970
and when there was some work to be done in the graphics side

24
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,536
of things, I did that, that was really fun.

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,718
I built most of Andy's neighborhood with some help

26
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:13,366
from some other people who built a few houses.

27
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:16,131
I created the street and the road

28
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:17,989
and I dressed the trees in and I worked

29
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,073
with somebody to make the trees renderable.

30
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:22,867
I also built Scud, the dog.

31
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,778
Scud started as a big sculpture

32
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:29,127
and sculpey of a big dog

33
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:33,491
and we had to figure out a way of wrapping a surface,

34
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:37,628
a CG surface around Scud and making it all kind of connect,

35
00:01:37,628 --> 00:01:39,855
and then articulate, make it move,

36
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:42,363
get the controls in so the animators could move it,

37
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,322
and then work with another people

38
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:47,155
to put color on him and fur on him.

39
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,819
I will spend a Saturday taking apart a camera,

40
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:55,492
taking all the old grease out and making it work again,

41
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,242
maybe making new parts of some of the old ones

42
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,340
that are broken and putting it back together,

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,427
or I'll go on a road trip and take pictures

44
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:05,000
'cause there's nothing better than road trips and cameras. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
