00:00:03,357 --> 00:00:04,735
- Earlier, we found that to make

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:07,309
a very bright image
with our pinhole camera,

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:10,081
we had to use a large aperture.

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,689
But when we did this, our resulting image

6
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,380
was blurry because light rays

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,338
from each point in our scene spread out

8
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:18,152
into a larger area on our image plane.

9
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,740
Here's an example.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,889
The light rays are
coming in from the right

11
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,745
and they're just about parallel,

12
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,181
like they're coming from
an object like the sun

13
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,393
that's really far away.

14
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:30,853
With a tiny aperture, just one tiny point

15
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:32,883
on the image plane would be illuminated

16
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,070
by these rays.

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,997
But to make a bigger aperture work,

18
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:39,218
we need to aim all of these light rays

19
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:42,827
onto a tiny point without
discarding any of them.

20
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:44,674
We want to bend them.

21
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:46,914
And what do we use when
we want to bend light?

22
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:47,900
A lens.

23
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,734
If we add a lens to our camera,

24
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:53,302
it will cause our light
rays to converge like this.

25
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,278
The point where these
parallel light rays converge

26
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:57,314
is known as the Focal Point.

27
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:59,767
It turns out that the shape
or curvature of the lens

28
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,970
determines how sharply
the light rays are bent.

29
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,398
If we increase the curvature of our lens,

30
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,867
the rays focus very close to the lens.

31
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,744
And if we decrease the curvature,

32
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,739
they focus farther away.

33
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,358
What we want is to focus the light rays

34
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,048
exactly on our image plane.

35
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,824
That will give us a sharp image.

36
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,236
And for any particular distance

37
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:20,220
between lens and image plane,

38
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,736
there's a lens design, or curvature,

39
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:24,373
that will focus the light rays

40
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:26,117
on the image plane.

41
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,877
We call the distance at which the lens

42
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:29,735
focuses these parallel rays

43
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:32,167
the Focal Length of the lens.

44
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,744
You can have a lens that focuses

45
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,174
close to the aperture

46
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,392
and you'll get a wide field of view.

47
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:40,010
We call that a Wide Angle Lens.

48
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,589
For example, a 28 millimeter lens,

49
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:44,400
like the one we're using here,

50
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,556
has a focal length of 28 millimeters

51
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,607
and produces an image
with a wide field of view.

52
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,303
Or you can have a lens that focuses light

53
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,135
further away from the aperture.

54
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:55,249
We call this a Long Lens.

55
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,028
For example, a 120 millimeter lens,

56
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,709
like the one we're using here,

57
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,965
has a focal length of 120 millimeters.

58
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:05,136
So we'll capture less
of the scene, like this.

59
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:06,523
While a 50 millimeter lens,

60
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,330
like the one we've switched to here,

61
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,236
gives us this natural-looking perspective.

62
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:14,148
For any given lens, the
film or light sensor

63
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,371
needs a certain amount of light

64
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:17,827
to record an image properly.

65
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,949
Too little, and it just sees darkness,

66
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:22,473
Too much, and it just sees white.

67
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:24,148
We control how much light it receives

68
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:26,823
by adjusting the size, or diameter,

69
00:02:26,823 --> 00:02:28,755
of the aperture, which we also

70
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,393
measure in millimeters.

71
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,273
Some cameras, like this one,

72
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:35,304
allow you to set the
aperture using this ring.

73
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,307
But the numbers on the ring

74
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:38,164
aren't measured in millimeters.

75
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,297
The numbers here are called F Stops

76
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:41,651
and is defined to be the ratio

77
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,505
of the focal length of the lens

78
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:46,008
to the diameter of the aperture.

79
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:48,228
So if we want a 25 millimeter aperture

80
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:50,193
on a 50 millimeter lens,

81
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:52,182
we'll set the F Stop to two

82
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:53,931
because 50 millimeters divided by

83
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,884
25 millimeters equals two.

84
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,460
F Stops are handy because they tell us

85
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,480
exactly how much light gets through,

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,952
no matter the focal length of the lens.

87
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,593
For example, if we set the F Stop

88
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:07,233
on a 100 millimeter lens to two,

89
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,936
we get the same amount of light

90
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,270
as we do with a 50 millimeter lens

91
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,573
with the F Stop set to two.

92
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:16,174
The F Stop is there for an important idea.

93
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,646
Let's stop here so you can get

94
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:21,407
some practice with it
in the next exercise.

95
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,380
And just to make it clear,

96
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,000
I did take that with an F Stop of two. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
