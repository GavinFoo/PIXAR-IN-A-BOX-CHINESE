00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:04,985
- In the previous video, we saw

3
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:07,162
how lenses can focus parallel light rays

4
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:08,952
to a point on our image plane,

5
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:10,785
resulting in a sharp image.

6
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:12,274
This means that if our image plane

7
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:14,503
is set at the focal length of our lens,

8
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:19,336
then objects that are very
far away appear sharp.

9
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,617
For example, imagine a scene with Joy

10
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:25,783
standing a mile away from
the camera, like this.

11
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:29,494
If we look at the scene
from the side, we get this.

12
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:31,533
Notice the light rays that bounce off Joy

13
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:34,468
and enter the camera are
approximately parallel.

14
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,586
If we place our image plane

15
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,408
at the focal length of the lens,

16
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:39,765
Joy will be in focus.

17
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:41,631
But what happens when
we try and make an image

18
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:44,228
of nearby objects in our scene?

19
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:45,969
Imagine we move the camera so that Joy

20
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:48,500
is standing just a few feet away.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,418
Now pick any point on Joy and look at

22
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,401
the light rays that are
heading from that point

23
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,421
toward the lens of our camera.

24
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,544
Notice that these light
rays aren't parallel,

25
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:57,624
they fan out.

26
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,604
Because they're hitting
the lens at an angle,

27
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:00,931
they are redirected to a point

28
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,133
a little farther away
behind the image plane.

29
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,224
Over here.

30
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:06,502
And where the light rays actually

31
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:07,665
hit the image plane,

32
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,730
they're spread out in larger circles

33
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,057
instead of tiny points.

34
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:13,501
This results in an image of Joy

35
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,367
which is out of focus.

36
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,494
To see this effect clearly,

37
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,748
check out this out of
focus shot of lights.

38
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:21,851
These blurry circles are
known as Circles of Confusion.

39
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,101
They're a result of light rays

40
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,968
which haven't been focused to a point

41
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,492
on the image plane.

42
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:28,028
And when an image is in focus,

43
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,275
the circles of confusion are so small,

44
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:33,285
they appear as points in our image.

45
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,628
We can bring Joy into focus

46
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,861
by moving the image plane back a little.

47
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,739
There.

48
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:42,251
At this distance, Joy
will be in sharp focus.

49
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,432
Remember with our pinhole camera

50
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:44,697
just the size of the pinhole

51
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,297
determined how blurry or sharp

52
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:48,203
everything in our image was.

53
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:49,571
And with a tiny pinhole,

54
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,590
the entire scene was in focus.

55
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,025
But now, with a lens in there,

56
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,971
only a slice of our
scene will be in focus.

57
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:58,617
And anything which moves outside

58
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:00,503
of this in-focus region,

59
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:03,520
either too close or too far away,

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,408
will appear out of focus.

61
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,674
This is known as Depth of Field.

62
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,206
Filmmakers control the depth of field

63
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,232
with their choice of lens

64
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,295
and aperture, or F Stop.

65
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,043
Let's do an example with multiple Joys

66
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:19,026
at different distances from our camera.

67
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,145
If our aperture is very small,

68
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:23,586
that would be with a large F Stop,

69
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,208
then the depth of field will be larger

70
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,404
and the transition from sharp to blurry

71
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:28,926
is very gradual.

72
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:31,333
To see this, let's start with a subject

73
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,366
that's in sharp focus.

74
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,012
As I move it farther away,

75
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:37,905
the blurry region
doesn't change very much.

76
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,423
This is Deep Depth of Field.

77
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:43,614
So more than one of our
Joys will be in focus.

78
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:45,842
Now, let's increase the
size of our aperture,

79
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:47,488
that is, a smaller F Stop,

80
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:50,179
and start again with our subject in focus.

81
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,352
Moving the subject even
just a little further away

82
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,132
causes the blurry region to get big fast.

83
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:57,442
This is called Shallow Depth of Field.

84
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,002
Now, just a tiny slice of our scene

85
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,259
will be in focus.

86
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,066
So with a small aperture, or large F Stop,

87
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,692
the depth of field is deep.

88
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,039
The entire scene is in focus.

89
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,865
With a larger aperture, or smaller F Stop,

90
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:12,502
the depth of field is shallow.

91
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:15,223
Only a small slice of
our scene is in focus.

92
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:16,797
In the next exercise, you'll have

93
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,735
the opportunity to explore

94
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:20,788
how both aperture and lens length

95
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,000
affect depth of field. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
