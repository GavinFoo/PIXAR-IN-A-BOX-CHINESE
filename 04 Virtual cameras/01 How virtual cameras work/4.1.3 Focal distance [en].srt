00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,353
- In the previous exercise you probably noticed

3
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:08,718
that a very small aperture results in a sharper image.

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,317
But it's a dim image,

5
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:11,859
because very few light rays

6
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:13,550
are making it through that pinhole

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,890
and entering the camera.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,484
We can make the image brighter

9
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,260
by expanding our aperture size,

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,932
but there is a trade-off:

11
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,116
when we do this, it results in a blurrier image.

12
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:25,154
Here is why.

13
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:26,550
Let's look at our scene again

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,928
and look at one point in that scene.

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,301
There is light bouncing all around our scene,

16
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:35,140
and at that point light rays are going in all directions.

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,285
Our pinhole only lets light from one direction through.

18
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,954
As we make it bigger, it lets more light rays through,

19
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:42,713
making the image brighter.

20
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,666
But this presents a new problem:

21
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,795
it lets light from our point

22
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,299
spread across more of the image plane.

23
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,097
That tiny point in our scene

24
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:53,266
now covers a big area at our image.

25
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,946
That's the image blur.

26
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,974
Aside from the size of our aperture,

27
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,265
there is another important feature of this camera

28
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:02,327
that we can manipulate.

29
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:04,665
That's the distance between our image plane

30
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,846
and the aperture.

31
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:08,441
I'm gonna call that distance the focal distance.

32
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,697
If we move the image plane closer to the aperture,

33
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,976
the objects in our scene appear smaller,

34
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:14,885
but we see more of the scene.

35
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:19,269
So we say our field of view widens when we do this.

36
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,886
If we move the image plane farther away from the aperture,

37
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:23,682
the opposite happens.

38
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:26,025
Now the objects in our scene appear bigger,

39
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:28,135
but we don't capture as much of the scene.

40
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:32,380
In this case, we'd say the field of view is narrower.

41
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,063
So, there is some kind of relationship

42
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:44,212
between the focal distance of the camera

43
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,453
and its field of view.

44
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,333
This is a really important concept.

45
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,892
So let's pause here.

46
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,526
In the next exercise you'll have a chance

47
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:55,637
to develop your understanding about what's going on here

48
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:58,482
by playing with a virtual pinhole camera

49
00:01:58,482 --> 00:02:00,218
with a variable distance between the aperture

50
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:02,485
and the image plane.

51
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:03,000
