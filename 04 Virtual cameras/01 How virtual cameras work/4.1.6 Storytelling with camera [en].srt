PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:05,846
- You remember Patrick from the first video in this lesson?

3
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:08,961
I've invited him here to talk a little bit about camera use.

4
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:09,696
- Cheese!

5
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:12,250
- Can you tell us a little bit about

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,408
how you use depth of field in storytelling?

7
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,695
- So, the one that has depth of view

8
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:21,328
is part of the storytelling is a short film

9
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:23,970
that I worked on called The Blue Umbrella.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,678
When the director, Saschka, approached me about doing

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,953
the cinematography, he wants the audience to feel like

12
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:35,531
they are kinda watching this love story unfold,

13
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:37,082
in front of their eyes.

14
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:41,161
So the idea was to try to use a longer lens

15
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,967
so that there's a distance between

16
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,246
the camera to the subject.

17
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,739
It's like when you're in love, you know?

18
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,734
You just don't look at anything else.

19
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:55,350
You kinda concentrate on the person in front of you.

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,275
And that's kind of the feeling we're trying to get.

21
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:59,609
(happy music)

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,239
- In addition to all the other choices you make,

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,355
you could also choose

24
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,133
to move the camera during a shot.

25
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,744
Do you ever use that to help tell a story?

26
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:12,703
- Oh, yeah, camera movement is very important.

27
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:15,295
For Inside Out, camera movement is a big part

28
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:18,249
of the camera structure of how the inside world works

29
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,013
and the outside world works.

30
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,477
The inside world is a perfect world?

31
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:25,575
It's imaginative.

32
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,836
So all the camera movement is very mechanical,

33
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,680
it's very deliberate.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,060
Whenever it's moving you can kinda predict where it's going.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,468
So everything is very formal.

36
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:39,962
On the outside world, on the other hand, is more organic,

37
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:41,397
depending on the moments.

38
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:45,267
So how we move the camera is very, very important.

39
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:49,568
- And you're also focusing just like with a real camera

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,754
to make sure the right things are in focus.

41
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:55,804
Do you ever use focus as a way of telling a story?

42
00:01:55,804 --> 00:01:57,401
Or the way you focus?

43
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:01,952
- Yes, actually on Inside Out, we used focus to try to

44
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:06,846
add to the imperfection of the real world, Riley's world.

45
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:09,611
Because Riley's world is based on a real location,

46
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:11,532
San Francisco, Minnesota.

47
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,747
We want the camera, it just feels natural

48
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:17,014
that the camera should feel real.

49
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:19,971
And imperfection is part of the real world.

50
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,830
And something about Pixar's focus

51
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,712
is that everything is always so perfect,

52
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,466
because we're inside a computer.

53
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,383
So we purposefully,

54
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:31,405
in act two and act three especially,

55
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,655
when the cameraman is trying to follow an action,

56
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:37,997
we purposefully miss some of the focus and then refocus.

57
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:39,533
It's just some of the subtlety

58
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,056
we're trying to do to try to get to the imperfection.

59
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,768
It's something that hopefully the audience can feel

60
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:47,376
but not something that they can just say oh, yeah,

61
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,339
I can see what they did.

62
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,462
- Thanks, this is fascinating, thanks for coming by.

63
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,000
- Well, thank you for having me, Adam. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
