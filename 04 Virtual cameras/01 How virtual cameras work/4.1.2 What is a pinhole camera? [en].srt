PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:05,094
- Hey. My name is Eben Ostby.

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:07,167
I've been working at
Pixar since we were just

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:11,583
half a dozen people working
on experimental short films.

5
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,616
One thing that hasn't changed since then

6
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:15,739
is the need for virtual cameras.

7
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,551
And to understand virtual cameras,

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,910
you need a firm grasp of
how physical cameras work.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,595
And I love cameras.

10
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:26,649
In fact, I collect and fix
and sometimes even build them.

11
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:30,001
I built this in a CAD system.

12
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,551
And printed it out with 3D
printing and it takes pictures.

13
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:36,434
(camera clicks) Like that.

14
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:38,210
And cameras come in all shapes and sizes,

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,435
like this little, baby twin-lens.

16
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:49,101
And this Classic American
Argus. (camera clicks)

17
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:51,499
So at Pixar, when we
design a virtual camera

18
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:56,398
our job is model what happens
inside physical cameras.

19
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,678
Have you ever thought about
what a camera really does

20
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:01,403
when we take a picture? (camera clicks)

21
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:03,957
You probably know that
a camera captures light

22
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,406
on a piece of film or image sensor.

23
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:07,909
But to understand how this works,

24
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,267
let's build a very simple camera.

25
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:13,045
We'll start with a box.
This is our camera body.

26
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:14,700
And a single piece of paper,

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,947
which represents our image sensor or film.

28
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:19,764
We'll call this the "image plane."

29
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:20,663
You know what?

30
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,684
Let's do this at a larger scale,

31
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:26,009
like using an office as our box.

32
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,235
Our scene is now outside the window.

33
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,890
And our image plane is the opposite wall.

34
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,712
We don't see a clear image.

35
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:35,296
The problem is any
point on our image plane

36
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,496
is getting hit by light from
everywhere in the scene.

37
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,706
What we want is for each
point on our image plane

38
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:43,539
to be hit by light from a
tiny region of the scene.

39
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,471
Look at what happens if
we cover up the window

40
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:48,043
except for a little hole.

41
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:51,565
We call this small hole the
"aperture" of our camera.

42
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:54,733
If you wait a few minutes for
your eyes to adjust, voila.

43
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,968
An image.

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,069
The reason it works,
is because the aperture

45
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,186
only lets certain light rays through.

46
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:04,042
At this point, here, on the image plane,

47
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,899
only light rays from one direction

48
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,524
can make it through the aperture.

49
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:10,585
And those light rays come
from light bouncing off

50
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:13,067
this place in the scene.

51
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,310
So the aperture is
filtering out any light rays

52
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,705
that don't come from the right direction.

53
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,514
This simple camera design is
known as a "pinhole camera."

54
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,682
If we replace the back wall of the room

55
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:25,043
with a great big sheet
of photographic film,

56
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,639
we could take a great picture that way.

57
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,962
Did you know that the word camera

58
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:31,245
comes from the Latin word for room?

59
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:33,943
The first cameras were
known as "camera obscura"

60
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,961
meaning "darkened room."

61
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:39,038
They were in fact,
room-sized like our office.

62
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:42,518
In the next exercise, you can
use this pinhole simulator

63
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:45,002
to take some virtual pictures.

64
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,997
You can adjust the size of
your pinhole, or aperture,

65
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:52,024
and press here to capture
an image. (camera clicks)

66
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:54,318
While doing so, you'll have
to answer some questions

67
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,008
about what's going on.

68
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,336
Such as, why is the image flipped?

69
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,352
And more importantly,

70
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,729
what happens if we change
the size of our aperture?

71
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,913
(camera snaps)

72
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,000
