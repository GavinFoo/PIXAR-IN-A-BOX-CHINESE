00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:03,387
(springing noises)

3
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:04,857
- We're a good way towards building a shot

4
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:07,643
that matches the sketch we got from the story department.

5
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:10,127
But before we continue, let's pause for a moment

6
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:12,077
to explore an interesting issue that comes up

7
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:14,098
when combining operations.

8
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,605
In the last exercise, you used the two operations

9
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,088
of scaling and translation to position some objects.

10
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:23,176
For example, suppose I start by translating this object

11
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:26,102
by five in X and three in Y,

12
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:29,704
and then scale by a factor of two.

13
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:30,996
But what if I change the order

14
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:34,920
and do scaling before translation?

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,451
In this case, I'll scale by a factor of two,

16
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:41,561
and then translate by five in X and three in Y.

17
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,528
Huh. I get a different result.

18
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:47,082
^ That means the order of operations matters

19
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:50,402
^ when we combine scaling and translation.

20
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:53,444
Let's try applying two different translations.

21
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:57,042
The first by, say, hmm, five in X and three in Y.

22
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:01,036
And the second by, say, two in X and four in Y.

23
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,685
And if I do these in the opposite order,

24
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:04,843
I get the same result.

25
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:06,492
^ So apparently, order doesn't matter

26
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:08,884
^ when combining two translations.

27
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,090
When order doesn't matter, mathematicians say

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,646
that the operations are commutative.

29
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,224
(magical chiming)

30
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:16,825
When order does matter, mathematicians say

31
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:21,956
the operations are (magical chiming) non-commutative.

32
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,373
Translations commute with each other

33
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:25,578
because addition is commutative.

34
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:28,412
^ But scaling and translation don't commute.

35
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:31,291
^ We'll study commutativity in more detail a little later.

36
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,404
In the meantime, use the next exercise

37
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:35,000
to get some practice with this concept. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
