00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,395
(springing noises)

3
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:05,438
- So far, we've looked at placement and sizing,

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,556
which are accomplished using the two operations

5
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:09,068
of translation and scaling.

6
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,947
And the animators really need the shot.

7
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:14,241
They're starting to casually scooter by your office

8
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,013
and check in on your progress.

9
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:17,726
Assembling a shot generally requires

10
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,259
that things be oriented properly

11
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,380
as well as being placed and sized.

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,772
Orienting an object generally consists

13
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,271
of one or more rotation operations.

14
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:28,723
So let's go back to our in-progress shot.

15
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:32,489
To position Bo Peep, we'll need all three operations.

16
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,652
I'll start by scaling her to her proper size.

17
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,533
Next, I'll use rotation to orient her

18
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,162
the way the sketch calls for.

19
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:43,865
And finally, I'll position her using translation.

20
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:46,735
We saw earlier that there are simple formulas

21
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:48,406
involving multiplication and addition

22
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:50,734
for the operations of scaling and translation.

23
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,740
The formulas for rotation are a little more complicated,

24
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,532
involving ideas from trigonometry.

25
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,657
Don't worry about the details too much just yet.

26
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,384
We'll get to that in a later lesson.

27
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,829
For now, I'd like to talk about why I chose

28
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,471
to do the operations in the order I did.

29
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:08,164
Scaling, rotation, and then translation.

30
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:12,135
Suppose I started instead with translation,

31
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:16,578
and then rotation, and finally scaling.

32
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,816
Bo Peep ends up in the wrong place.

33
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:21,293
So the order can matter a lot.

34
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:24,819
Remember what it's called when the order matters?

35
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,028
^Right. Non-commutativity.

36
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,534
Keeping non-commutativity in mind,

37
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,416
go ahead and use all three operations

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,889
to finish your interpretation of Andy's room.

39
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:38,929
Once you're done, you'll get an approval from the director.

40
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,959
After that, you can create as many scenes

41
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,608
of your own design as you want.

42
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,547
Can you make some options that the art department

43
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:46,072
and director didn't even ask for?

44
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,055
Making a great film is all about exploring

45
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,480
many different options and picking the best one.

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Have fun! aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
