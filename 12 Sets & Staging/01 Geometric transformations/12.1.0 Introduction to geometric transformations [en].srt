PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:03,639
- At Pixar we build our movies shot-by-shot.

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:04,858
A shot is something we make

4
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:06,920
^by staging our characters in a set

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,257
^and then framing them up through a camera.

6
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:12,424
Every time the cameras point-of-view changes...

7
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,052
^- That's a new shot.

8
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:17,482
^On average, a Pixar movie is made of about 1,800 shots.

9
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:20,553
That's a new shot almost every three seconds.

10
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,050
- In animation we don't just dive in

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,591
and start creating shots.

12
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,534
First we need to figure out the story.

13
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,761
And we do this by making a story reel.

14
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,853
It'a a fast, rough version of the film

15
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,255
made of tens of thousands of drawings.

16
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,799
- The story reel does more than just tell the story.

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,511
It hints at a lot of things, such as composition,

18
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:41,191
camera movement, performance and location.

19
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,211
- The story reel gives us a good place to start thinking

20
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,718
about how we're gonna make these shots for real.

21
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:47,738
Real, like in the virtual, three-dimensional world

22
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:49,264
of computer graphics.

23
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:52,835
- And math is literally the foundation for all the processes

24
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,297
we use to create these films in the computer.

25
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:57,851
This lesson will show you how geometric transformations,

26
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,755
which are basic functions to manipulate the position,

27
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,214
orientation, and size of an object,

28
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:05,768
are an essential part of building our shots.

29
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:06,638
You ready?

30
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:09,151
- Of course. Let's go.

31
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,492
- I work in the Set's Department as a Set Dresser.

32
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:14,538
Often, the set starts as just an empty room.

33
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:17,955
Using the story reel, and reference from the art department,

34
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,572
I will work out what objects we need

35
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,534
to include in the set initially.

36
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:23,809
At this stage, before cameras are in there,

37
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:26,049
it's not about making the set pretty.

38
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:27,815
It's about supporting the action.

39
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:30,171
So I only include things that are essential

40
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:33,515
in staging the shot. I select the virtual models I need,

41
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:35,476
and they appear in the center of the set.

42
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:37,648
I move them into place around the room,

43
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,946
turning them and re-sizing them if necessary.

44
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,607
Each of these changes to the model

45
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:45,135
is accomplished using geometric transformations.

46
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:48,164
When I'm done with this first pass I send it to staging.

47
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:49,953
- My department, Camera and Staging,

48
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:51,869
is where we figure out how to shoot the movie

49
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,941
through the lens of a virtual camera.

50
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,003
So let's take a look at the shot we're gonna make.

51
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,774
- Oh no! Our dinosaur has escaped.

52
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,992
- In film-making, camera movement is a powerful tool

53
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:05,019
to convey emotion in your audience in a subconscious way.

54
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:09,253
Is the camera hand-held? On a dolly or a crane?

55
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,907
Is the character experiencing some important moment?

56
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:14,931
A moment of significance that we're pushing in on?

57
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,108
For this shot we're gonna follow the action with our camera,

58
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:19,991
panning with Bonnie as she moves through the space.

59
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:23,673
- Oh no! Our dinosaur has escaped.

60
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:25,907
When we're done setting up the camera,

61
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:28,206
the shot goes back to Set Dressing.

62
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,751
- Now that I know what the set looks like

63
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,704
through the camera, I can take a more detailed pass.

64
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,184
I'll add objects to make the set feel more believable

65
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,980
and support the story.

66
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,349
Sometimes this means adding a lot of stuff in messy piles

67
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,405
to feel like a teenagers room.

68
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,551
Or fill the crates in a bookshelf so it looks like a daycare

69
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:48,104
but feels like a prison. And all that math?

70
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:50,335
Well, we use geometric transformations

71
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:52,505
at every step of building the shot.

72
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,211
- In this lesson, you'll get a chance

73
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,744
to use geometric transformations,

74
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:58,008
and explore concepts as simple as addition

75
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:00,110
and as spicy as trigonometry

76
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,000
to build your own shot. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
