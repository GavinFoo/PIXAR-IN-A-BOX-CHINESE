00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,180
- Did you get final approval from the director?

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,771
Congratulations.

4
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,730
(crunch)

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,053
Earlier, we saw that translation and scaling don't commute.

6
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:17,802
Let's see if we can get a better understanding

7
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:19,980
of what's going on using some algebra.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,610
Suppose we translate by an amount

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,562
of five and x and three and y.

10
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:29,160
Pick a point, x zero y zero, in the image we're translating.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,039
That point goes to a point, x one, y one,

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,830
given by, x one equals x zero plus five,

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,800
y one equals y zero plus three.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,260
Now, suppose we scale about the origin by a factor of four.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,970
Where does x one y one go?

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,270
Let's call the point it goes to, x two y two.

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,560
Scaling says, x two equals four times x one,

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,400
and y two equals four times y one.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,069
Substitute our expressions for x one and y one.

20
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:09,950
X two equals four times x zero plus five

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,500
which equals four times x zero plus four times five,

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,040
which equals four times x zero plus 20.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,340
Y two is equal to four times y zero plus three

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,800
which equals four times y zero plus 12.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,390
This factor in front of x and y is four.

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,720
So the effective scale factor is still four.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,930
However, the effective translation amount

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,690
is 20 and x and 12 and y.

29
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,770
For comparison, let's do the operations

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,810
in the opposite order.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,030
Scale first that is.

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,200
X one equals four times x 0,

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,450
and y one equals four times y zero.

34
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,079
Then translate...

35
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,250
So algebraically, x two equals x one plus five,

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,880
which equals four times x zero plus five

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,470
and y two equals y one plus three

38
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,050
which equals four times y zero plus three.

39
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,389
Clearly the blue equations

40
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,050
aren't the same as the red equations.

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,020
But in either case, we can write the results

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,560
of combining scaling and translation in the form

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,069
x two equals s times x zero plus t x,

44
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,740
and y two equals s times y zero plus t y.

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,732
Where t x stands for the effective,

46
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,199
or final translation amount in x,

47
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,460
and t y is the effective translation amount in y.

48
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,500
When two or more transformations are combined

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,300
we call it a composite transformation.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,453
In the next exercise, you'll be ask to verify

51
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:50,090
that this general form for composite transformation

52
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,720
consisting of scales and translations always holds,

53
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,509
no matter how many scales and translations are combined,

54
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,000
and no matter what the order. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
