PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,859
Huh. Hah.
Come on!

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,039
So one of the mentors that was really important to me in deciding that

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,070
I wanted to go into computer graphics was Maria Palazzi.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,210
She was the director of

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,290
the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,860
at Ohio State University.

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,720
And she met with me as a high schooler.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,599
And I talked to her about my interests.

10
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:25,050
And she said, "There's a field where you can use your love for art and design,

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,849
and your love for science and coding, and that field is computer graphics.

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,279
And she showed me her center and walked me around.

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,530
And I could see all of the cool things that the graduate students there were doing.

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,480
And I thought,
"This is my place."

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,920
So this is some of my student work that you're looking at.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,890
One of my favorite things to do with my student work was to understand how

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,830
signals could overlap each other to create different looks in a shader network.

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,240
And so this is a lot of me playing with shader networks to see,

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,850
"Gosh, can I change a high-frequency fractal,

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,710
and can that alternate between a saturated and a desaturated

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,030
version of this texture?"

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,950
And I thought that that was so cool that you could use these relatively simple signals

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,688
to combine complex texture maps and get these interesting looks in the end.

24
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:13,170
What I loved about doing this work is that every time

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,759
I would write a piece of code or make a connection,

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,049
I could see a visual result right away from what I was doing.

27
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,170
And that's how I loved learning how to code –

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,780
to have this visual result from the work that I was doing was so rewarding.

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,509
And for me, I was a really active learner.

30
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,950
And so it was really helpful to see a result as soon as I made something.

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,759
Another reason I went into computer graphics

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,369
instead of live-action film is what was happening at the time.

33
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,479
I was so inspired by the short "Bunny."

34
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,759
I thought it was one of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen.

35
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,509
I've always been so moved by bringing animals and characters to life.

36
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,749
And that's something that you can do with puppetry quite well.

37
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,770
But that's something that computer graphics does exceptionally well.

38
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,328
It is just the right format for those things.

39
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,229
And "Ratatouille"
had just come out.

40
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,869
And I found out that Pixar was going to come visit our campus.

41
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,508
And I could not wait to talk to the people who made the delicious looking food.

42
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:12,650
But we had a really good conversation.
And they liked my work.

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,289
And so they asked if I would come to Pixar and do some shading. So I did.

44
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:21,699
And my boss was the lady who made the beautiful food in "Ratatouille," Athena Xenakis.

45
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:24,750
It was amazing when I showed up and got that assignment on the first day.

46
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,560
I just could not believe my luck.
I was so excited.

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,239
And on my resumé, there was a line that said "Hobbies."

48
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,139
And in the line that said "Hobbies,"

49
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,509
it said, "knitting, playing piano, and sewing."

50
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,780
And one of the supervising technical directors looked at that line

51
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,780
and said, "Wait. You can understand how to use computer programs, and you can sew.

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,878
Do you know there are jobs for people that do that at Pixar?" And I said "No."

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,709
And he said, "Do you want to come and try that?"

54
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,068
And I said, "Yeah!"
So they found a spot for me on "Wall-E".

55
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:59,180
We had just gone through getting some notes back from an audience preview.

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,060
And the characters weren't a size that made the audience happy.

57
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,860
So we resized some of the characters, and they needed their outfits refitted –

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,829
which is perfect intern work.

59
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,680
And then they gave me Ellie.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,799
And they asked me to dress and tailor Ellie.

61
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,750
And I just could not believe my luck.

62
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,680
She is the most amazing and wonderful character.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,889
She's outgoing and she's fun and she's smart. Ellie went well.

64
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,620
They liked the way she looked.
And I was happy with it too.

65
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,938
So, they asked me to work on Merida, which was really awesome. And that went well.

66
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:33,000
So then they asked me to work on Disgust and Riley and all Riley's mom's clothes,

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
which was a lot of fun.

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,139
And now I'm working on something I totally can't talk about on camera.

69
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,239
If this is a field that's interesting to you,

70
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,930
or if there's any field that's interesting to you,

71
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,188
and you look around, and you see not a lot of people in that field

72
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:49,818
"look like me," it's ok.
You're gonna find your people.

73
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:54,299
Just go into it, get some great mentors, make some great friends,

74
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,109
and just believe if you want to be there bad enough, it's your place.

75
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:04,430
Kitty! I'm sorry, there's a cat.
[Laughter] There's a cat.

76
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh God, there's a cat.
