00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:05,783
- Hi, I'm Fran, a technical director

3
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:08,006
here at Pixar Animation Studios.

4
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,580
I'm talking to you today from the lobby

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,350
of one of the beautiful buildings of the Pixar campus.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,923
As we learned in the previous video,

7
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:16,928
when we create shots to make up our movies

8
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:18,354
we need to assemble the environment

9
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:20,464
where the story takes place.

10
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:22,876
If I were to build this kind of environment,

11
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:24,799
I'd start by placing the really big forms

12
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:27,197
like the walls and the floor.

13
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:28,872
Then I'd place the dramatic elements

14
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:32,034
like this gargantuan fireplace behind me.

15
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:35,148
Then I'd move down to the medium sized elements

16
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:38,136
and do selection and placement of the couches,

17
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:41,055
tables and chairs.

18
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:43,178
Finally, I'd move down to the really small details

19
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:44,794
like the magazines on the table

20
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,563
and the pieces of wood in the fireplace.

21
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:49,530
All of these items need to be positioned

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,443
using the mathematical operation of translation,

23
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:55,103
properly sized using the scaling operation

24
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,239
and oriented using rotations.

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,792
These operations are all examples of

26
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,219
fundamental geometric transformations.

27
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,506
We'll spend the remainder of this lesson

28
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,721
looking more closely at them.

29
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,721
For our films, these transformations control

30
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:09,455
what's going on in a virtual three-dimensional space.

31
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,730
^Meaning that each point has three coordinates,

32
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,553
^X, Y and Z.

33
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,400
^But for this lesson we're gonna simplify a bit

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,503
and look at laying out floor plans in two dimensions,

35
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:20,094
like we're viewing them from above.

36
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:23,824
^So points need only two coordinates, X and Y.

37
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,620
^The X coordinate says how far to the right a point is,

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,303
^and the Y coordinate says how far up it is.

39
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:31,751
^This point for instance has X coordinate three

40
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,620
^and Y coordinate five.

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,042
^Before we begin building our own shot from Toy Story,

42
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,012
^let's review how to plot points in 2D

43
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,000
using the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
