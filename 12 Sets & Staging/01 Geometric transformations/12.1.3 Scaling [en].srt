2
00:00:00,596 --> 00:00:03,219
(techno music)

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,879
- To hit our design goal given to us

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,960
from the story department,

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,468
we'll also have to resize objects in our scene.

6
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:11,509
For example, I can put Buzz into the shot,

7
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,003
but he's clearly not the size indicated in the sketch.

8
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,558
We can change the size of Buzz, say making

9
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:21,099
him twice as big by using the scaling operation.

10
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:23,479
To scale the object to twice its initial size,

11
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:25,696
I have to multiply the coordinates of each point

12
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,856
in the object by a factor of two.

13
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:32,058
As before with translation, I can pick any initial point.

14
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,444
Call its coordinates x0 and y0.

15
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:39,697
After scaling it becomes a point x1 y1.

16
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:41,542
This formula shows that the coordinates

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,618
of each point gets multiplied by two.

18
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,917
More generally, making something s times

19
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,180
as big means multiplying by s.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,789
If s is larger than one, things get bigger.

21
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,808
And if s is less than one, but still positive,

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,721
things get smaller.

23
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,393
We can summarize this by saying that the

24
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,406
mathematics of scaling is multiplication.

25
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:07,773
If the scaling factor in x is bigger than the one in y,

26
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,072
I stretch the object out horizontally.

27
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:12,334
Think about what would happen if

28
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,925
the y factor is bigger than x.

29
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:18,533
Also, think about what would happen if s is negative.

30
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,587
We generally need to both scale and translate

31
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:23,527
objects to put them where we want.

32
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:25,489
I've already scaled the Luxoball so I

33
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,694
can position it using translation.

34
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:30,249
Again, as I click on an initial position,

35
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,967
you can see where that point goes

36
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,414
once it's gone through both operations.

37
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:37,051
The formulas tell us that two operations

38
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,220
are being performed.

39
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,414
In this next exercise, your assignment

40
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:44,282
is to add to the shot you created in the last exercise

41
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,232
by adding objects that require both

42
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,781
translation and scaling operations.

43
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,870
Remember if they require rotation,

44
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,194
you shouldn't place them in the shot just yet.

45
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,182
(strong drum beat)

46
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,168
Take your time, but honestly the

47
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,700
animation department has been waiting

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,384
for this shot for like two weeks.

49
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,000
So, see you in 10 minutes. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
