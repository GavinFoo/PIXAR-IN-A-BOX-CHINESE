PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:02,134
(bouncing noises)

3
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:04,453
- Now that we know how to plot points

4
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:05,986
on a coordinate plane, we're ready

5
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:07,526
to start designing a shot.

6
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:09,873
Let's take a closer look at this sketch that we got

7
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:11,652
of Andy's room from Toy Story.

8
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:14,054
We can see that Buzz and Bo Peep

9
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:16,817
are laid out on the floor and on the bed

10
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,257
in sort of a haphazard sort of way.

11
00:00:19,257 --> 00:00:20,496
We can also see in this sketch,

12
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:22,198
that there's a question.

13
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,108
Where do we want to put the lamp?

14
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,784
Do we want it next to the bed,

15
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,651
so that the person who lives here can use it?

16
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,244
Or do we want it on the dresser,

17
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:31,285
to mean that the adult is using it?

18
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:34,219
Everywhere you put something, means something.

19
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,404
And really good computer graphics

20
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,055
tells a story in every single placement

21
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:42,157
of every single prop.

22
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,556
To build the shot, we've received this set of objects

23
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:46,692
from the modeling department to work with.

24
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:49,934
At Pixar, we call such a collection a model catalog.

25
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:53,081
Since in this lesson we're working in 2D,

26
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:55,095
our objects are 2D images.

27
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,199
But when we do this for real in a Pixar movie,

28
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,759
our assets are 3-dimensional models.

29
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,206
In either the 2D or 3D case,

30
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:04,569
we pick a reference point on the

31
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,871
object to aid with placement.

32
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,730
We could choose any reference point we like.

33
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,592
In this lesson, we'll choose the lower left corner.

34
00:01:12,592 --> 00:01:14,809
Objects brought into the shot from the model catalog

35
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,239
will appear with the reference point at the origin.

36
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,804
To lay out my shot, I start with the dresser,

37
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:23,599
since it's one of the bigger forms I'll need to work with.

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,263
Once the object is in the shot,

39
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:26,971
I can position it wherever I want

40
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,049
using the translation operation.

41
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,513
For instance, lets move it five units

42
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,200
to the right, and five units upwards.

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,203
To translate the entire object,

44
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:38,944
we have to translate each point in the object.

45
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:41,292
So, if I pick this point on the initial object.

46
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:44,271
Call its coordinates x zero and y zero,

47
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,388
it gets moved to this point after translation.

48
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:49,605
Call the coordinates of this translated point

49
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:52,122
x one and y one.

50
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,816
This formula over here tells us

51
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:56,349
that the mathematics of translation is addition.

52
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,379
As I click on a point in its initial position,

53
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,171
you see where that point goes

54
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,902
as well as what's happening to the coordinates.

55
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:07,867
So whenever you see objects changing position in our films,

56
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,215
you know that translation, and therefore addition,

57
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:12,687
is going on under the hood.

58
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,441
Your first assignment is to select objects

59
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,654
from the model catalog to create a first pass

60
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:19,384
at that drawing you got from the story department.

61
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,394
To keep things simple for this first assignment,

62
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:23,943
we've only given you the translation operation,

63
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,514
so you won't be able to layout the whole shot.

64
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,261
Your job is to figure out which objects

65
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,710
you can place using only translation.

66
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,169
You shouldn't pick objects that are

67
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:35,371
going to require re-sizing or rotation just yet.

68
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,759
And if you add an object by mistake,

69
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,020
you can always click remove.

70
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,000
Good luck. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
