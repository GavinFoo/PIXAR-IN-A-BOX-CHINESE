00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:03,302
(Springing sound)

3
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:05,204
- In the previous exercise, you should have found

4
00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:07,531
that length OA is R cosine theta.

5
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:12,357
But why? First notice that OPA is a right triangle.

6
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:14,569
So we can use sine and cosine.

7
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:18,158
OA is the side adjacent to theta.

8
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:21,748
Meaning that OA equals R cosine theta.

9
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:28,655
Similarly, AP prime equals R sine theta. Good.

10
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:32,528
So we need to show that angle DP prime A is phi.

11
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:36,842
That's because there are similar triangles lurking in there.

12
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:42,264
In particular, this triangle, and this triangle are similar.

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,895
To see that, notice that this angle is equal to this angle.

14
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:49,496
Because of the opposite angle theorem,

15
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:54,416
notice also that this angle is 90 degrees, as is this angle.

16
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,328
Meaning that the two triangles share two angles.

17
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:00,465
They must also share the third angle,

18
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:04,193
because all three angles must add up to 180 degrees.

19
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:09,064
Thus, CP prime A is phi. Now we're set.

20
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:13,042
One thing we're looking for is this distance,

21
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:15,947
OC, because that's X prime.

22
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:20,230
As we observed earlier, OC is equal to OB minus BC.

23
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,331
So X prime equals OB minus BC.

24
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:28,509
And since BC equals AD, we can write

25
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,905
X prime equals OB minus AD.

26
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:36,301
But what's OB? It's adjacent to phi,

27
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:40,825
so cosine phi equals OB over OA.

28
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:44,461
And we know that OA equals R cosine theta.

29
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:49,983
So cosine phi equals OB over R cosine theta.

30
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:54,290
And OB equals R cosine theta, cosine phi.

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,685
So OB equals R cosine phi times cosine theta.

32
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,180
But we know that R cosine phi is just X,

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,151
so OB equals X cosine theta. Now what's AD?

34
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:13,497
Well, AD is opposite phi in the triangle DP prime A.

35
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:17,388
So sine phi equals AD over AP prime.

36
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:22,270
And we know that AP prime equals R sine theta.

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,527
So sine phi equals AD over R sine theta,

38
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:33,194
which means that AD equals R sine theta sine phi.

39
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:37,292
Which can be rearranged to be R sine phi times sine theta,

40
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,865
and we know that R sine phi is just Y.

41
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:45,961
So AD equals Y sine theta. Okay, so that means

42
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,172
X prime equals X cosine theta minus Y sine theta.

43
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,560
So we're halfway there.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,039
Now we just need to know what Y prime is.

45
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,571
CP prime is Y prime, and it can be written as

46
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:04,014
CP prime equals DP prime plus AB.

47
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,718
DP prime is adjacent to phi,

48
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:12,836
so cosine phi equals DP prime over AP prime.

49
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,199
But AP prime is R sine theta.

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,442
So, cosine phi equals DP prime over R sine theta.

51
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:25,349
And DP prime equals R sine theta times cosine phi,

52
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,598
which equals X sine theta.

53
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,392
AB is opposite phi, so sine phi equals AB divided by OA.

54
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:37,394
But OA is R cosine theta,

55
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:42,348
so sine phi equals AB over R cosine theta.

56
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,914
And that means AB equals R sine phi times cosine theta.

57
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:53,786
But R sine phi is just Y, so AB equals Y cosine theta.

58
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:57,166
Putting this together Y prime equals X sine theta

59
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:01,782
plus Y cosine theta. Yay! We did it!

60
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:07,480
In summary, X prime equals X cosine theta minus Y sine theta

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,279
and Y prime equals X sine theta plus Y cosine theta.

62
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,454
You hung in there, and now you've seen a super useful

63
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:16,826
and prevalent formula.

64
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,855
Whether you're doing computer graphics

65
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,394
or building bridges or triangulating positions,

66
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,048
you're gonna see these formulas come up again

67
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:24,305
and again and again.

68
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:27,000
