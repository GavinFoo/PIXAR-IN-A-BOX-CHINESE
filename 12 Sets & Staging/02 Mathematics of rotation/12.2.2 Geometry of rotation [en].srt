00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:03,301
(bouncing noises)

3
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,707
- Now we know the coordinates of a few

4
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:07,278
^special points when they're rotated.

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,450
To create our software tools for setting up shots,

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,935
we need to have formulas for where

7
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:13,367
every point goes when rotated.

8
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,684
That is if we start with an arbitrary point,

9
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:19,177
x y, we'd like to know the coordinates of x prime y prime,

10
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:22,071
with a point where it ends up after rotation.

11
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,361
The formulas we'll come up with aren't too complicated,

12
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,364
in fact, here they are.

13
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:31,275
X prime equals x cosine theta minus y sine theta.

14
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:36,571
Y prime equals x sine theta plus y cosine theta.

15
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,392
So knowing x, y, and theta, you can compute

16
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:43,090
x prime and y prime, but where do these formulas come from?

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,461
Well there's a couple of different

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,197
ways to get these formulas.

19
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:48,729
One is to use properties of linear transformations.

20
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,686
(light turns on)

21
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,909
^(xylophone sound)

22
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:55,212
A more elementary way to derive these formulas

23
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:57,589
is using the basic definitions of Trigonometry.

24
00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:59,448
And it'll take us a little work to get there,

25
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:01,890
so roll up your sleeves and tie back your hair.

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,339
(wind whistling)

27
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,621
(gun cocking)

28
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,409
Let's call the point we start with, p,

29
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,140
and the point it gets rotated to, p prime.

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,033
We need to construct some other points to help us,

31
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,831
so let's go back to what we already know,

32
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,655
and break down the problem.

33
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,888
First, let's rotate the diagram,

34
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:20,690
and imagine OP is the X-axis.

35
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,438
This looks like the situation

36
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:24,247
we saw in the previous video when we

37
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:27,316
rotated the point one zero on the x-axis.

38
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:30,238
So, we drop a perpendicular from P prime

39
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:32,873
to the x-axis to define a new point A.

40
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,914
^Now, let's reverse the rotation,

41
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:38,307
^and drop a perpendicular from A,

42
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,511
^to the x-axis to define a point B.

43
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:44,009
^Similarly, drop a perpendicular

44
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,337
^from P prime to get point C.

45
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:50,105
^Observe that the X coordinate of A,

46
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:52,465
^line OB, is greater than the

47
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:56,220
^ x-coordinate of P prime, line OC.

48
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,974
^So we must subtract a certain amount.

49
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:04,028
^The amount we subtract is the length of the new line AD.

50
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:06,587
^Recall the coordinates of P prime we're looking for

51
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,276
^are defined by OC for the x-coordinate,

52
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:12,562
^and CP prime for the y-coordinate.

53
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,238
^Finally, drop a perpendicular from P,

54
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:18,791
^to the x-axis, to create a point E.

55
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,108
^This diagram now has all the information we need.

56
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,959
^Let's get some practice using this diagram,

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,960
^by deriving a couple of formulas we'll need later.

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,288
^Supposed r is the distance from the origin O to P.

59
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:35,967
^And let phi be the angle OP makes with the x-axis.

60
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:40,084
^The distance EP is y, and the distance OE is x.

61
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:45,175
^EP is opposite phi, so sine phi equals EP over r.

62
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:50,943
^But EP is y, so sine phi equals y over r.

63
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:55,124
^And that means y equals r sine phi.

64
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:57,220
^Similarly, OE is adjacent to phi,

65
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,514
^so cosine phi equals OE over r.

66
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:06,680
^But OE is just x, so cosine phi equals x over r,

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,241
^and that means x equals r cosine phi.

68
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:14,229
Wow, that was a lot of Trigonometry!

69
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,414
Before we proceed, see if you can answer

70
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,645
a few general questions about

71
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:19,660
^this diagram in the next exercise.

72
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,000
^Good luck. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
