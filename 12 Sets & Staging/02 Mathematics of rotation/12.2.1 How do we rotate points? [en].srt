(switch clicks)

4
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:05,193
- In this tutorial, we're gonna take a closer look

5
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:07,143
at the algebra of rotations.

6
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:09,367
We'll be working with the trigonometric functions

7
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,601
known as sine and cosine.

8
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,898
Let's start by rotating about the origin by an angle theta.

9
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,384
The usual convention is that rotating

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,053
by a positive angle is a counterclockwise motion,

11
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,838
and rotating by a negative angle is a clockwise motion.

12
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:24,859
We'd like to find a formula

13
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,062
that tells us where every point x, y goes when rotated.

14
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,686
Let's let x prime, y prime be the coordinates

15
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:34,633
of the point x, y after rotation.

16
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,117
We wanna find formulas for x prime and y prime,

17
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:40,554
in terms of x, y, and theta.

18
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:43,644
One such point is really easy.

19
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:47,219
What happens to the point zero, zero when rotated?

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,589
It stays still.

21
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,790
So x prime equals zero, and y prime equals zero.

22
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,784
What about the point one, zero?

23
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:01,377
It gets rotated to a point x prime, y prime as shown here.

24
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:05,651
To determine formulas for x prime and y prime in this case,

25
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,040
drop a perpendicular from x prime, y prime to the x axis.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,758
The orange length is x prime,

27
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,730
and the magenta length is y prime.

28
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,657
Notice that the orange, magenta,

29
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:19,351
and green triangle is a right triangle.

30
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,324
Notice that the length of the green line,

31
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:23,878
the hypotenuse of the triangle, is one,

32
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:27,081
because the point one, zero is one unit away

33
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,336
from the origin.

34
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:30,821
And the lengths don't change when you rotate.

35
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:34,280
Notice too that the magenta line is the line opposite theta,

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,622
and it has length y prime, which we don't know just yet.

37
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,108
The ratio of the opposite side

38
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,941
over the hypotenuse is sine theta.

39
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:47,212
That is, y prime over one equals sine theta,

40
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:51,052
or in other words, y prime equals sine theta.

41
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:52,925
(switch clicks on)

42
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,497
(gentle ringing)

43
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:58,266
Similarly, the orange line is adjacent to theta,

44
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,937
and has length x prime,

45
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:02,956
so if I form the ratio of adjacent over hypotenuse,

46
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:07,088
I get x prime over one equals cosine theta,

47
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,990
meaning that x prime equals cosine theta.

48
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,355
This tells me that the point one, zero gets rotated

49
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:17,038
to the point cosine theta, sine theta.

50
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,000
Use the next exercise to get some practice with these ideas. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
