2
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:05,596
- You should now have a good
feeling for the relationship

3
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:08,423
between position, speed and acceleration.

4
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,632
Before we can (mumbles)
formulas to describe how

5
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:13,012
the particles will move
based on the laws of physics,

6
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,562
We need to revisit how we think about

7
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:16,505
the speed of the particle.

8
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:18,910
We need to know not only
how fast it's moving,

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,528
but also the direction of motion.

10
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,825
In this case downward.

11
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,079
We are using idea called a
vector to represent things

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,366
that have both the size and the direction.

13
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,903
Vectors are joined as arrows.

14
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,892
The direction is which way it's pointing,

15
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:33,775
and the length of the
arrow called the magnitude

16
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:36,194
of the vector, indicates it's size.

17
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:38,550
We call this point,
the tail of the vector,

18
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,512
and this point, the head of the vector.

19
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,650
A vector called the
velocity, is used to describe

20
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,792
the speed and direction of the particle.

21
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,394
A short vector means the
particle is moving slowly.

22
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:52,584
A long vector indicates that
the particle is moving quickly.

23
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:55,097
In this diagram the
balls motion is downward,

24
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,569
so the velocity vector points downward.

25
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,237
If the particle is accelerating,

26
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,853
for instance due to gravity,

27
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,588
the length of the velocity
vector will increase over time

28
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:05,816
since the speed is increasing.

29
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,232
Acceleration is also a
vector because it too,

30
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:10,177
has a magnitude in direction.

31
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:12,486
But notice the size of
the acceleration vector

32
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:15,483
doesn't change as the ball falls.

33
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:20,114
As we saw on the last video,

34
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,318
a particle falling under
the influence of gravity

35
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,179
has a constant acceleration.

36
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:25,898
That is both the direction

37
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:28,465
and size of the acceleration
vector is constant.

38
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:30,450
As shown here.

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,497
We also need to add vectors together.

40
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,711
We do this using the head to tail rule.

41
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,763
For example, if we need
to add vectors v and w,

42
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:40,759
we move w so that v's head is at w's tail.

43
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,253
Like this.

44
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,614
The resulting vector written v+w,

45
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:47,330
goes from v's tail to w's head.

46
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,287
Okay, that's a lot of new ideas.

47
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,911
So let's pass here for you
to use the next exercise

48
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,671
to try this all out.

49
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,316
We couldn't make our
films without vectors.

50
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,952
Vectors are being used any
time you see anything moving

51
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,000
in our films. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
