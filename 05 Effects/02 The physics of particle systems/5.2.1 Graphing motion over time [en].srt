00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:06,275
- In this lesson, we'll revisit
our ping pong ball simulator

3
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:08,134
but this time from a mathematical

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,300
or quantitative perspective.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,843
By the end of the lesson,

6
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:13,098
you'll learn everything you need

7
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:15,254
to code up your own
ping pong ball simulator

8
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:17,221
and much more.

9
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,952
Specifically, we are going to develop

10
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,150
mathematical formulas to do three things.

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,219
One. Describe how particles move based on

12
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,745
laws of physics.

13
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,313
Two. Control how
particles collide with the

14
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:32,067
walls of the container
and with each other.

15
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,531
Three. Create a method
to track particle motion

16
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:35,704
forward in time.

17
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,730
To begin to understand how particles move

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,082
let's draw different kinds of motion.

19
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,264
By motion, we mean how
the position of particles

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,256
will change over time.

21
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:48,611
We got an idea of how things
move in our animation lesson.

22
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,631
In that lesson, we animated a ball

23
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,794
by drawing it in different
positions over time

24
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:56,373
using each frame indicated
at the bottom of the screen.

25
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,383
If we draw the ball
moving an equal distance

26
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,386
between each frame,

27
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:02,402
it looks like it's sliding
along a friction-less surface.

28
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:03,701
The speed isn't changing.

29
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,584
It's constant.

30
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,660
If we plot the position
of the ball over time,

31
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,360
we get a straight line.

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,929
Here, time is expressed
on the horizontal axis

33
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:13,226
and the distance the ball has moved

34
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:16,635
is plotted on the vertical axis.

35
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,414
The slope of the line tells us how fast

36
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:19,247
it's moving.

37
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,971
A steeper slope means a higher speed.

38
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,660
The slope is a change in position

39
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,566
divided by the change in time.

40
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,971
Now, what if we wanted to plot the ball's

41
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,900
speed over time?

42
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,602
If the ball speed doesn't change at all,

43
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:32,910
we get a plot like this:

44
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,846
A straight horizontal line.

45
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,409
A harder challenge is animating the ball

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,575
so it actually looks like
it is being acted upon

47
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,139
by gravity.

48
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,037
To do that, we have to
increase the distance

49
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,233
that the ball travels between each frame.

50
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:49,022
This is because the ball
needs to speed up as it falls.

51
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:50,649
When we plot the ball's position over time

52
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:51,536
we get a curve.

53
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:53,636
This is because at each
frame we are changing

54
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:55,102
the slope of the line.

55
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:58,093
Now, if we plot the speed
of the ball over time,

56
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,380
we get a non-horizontal line.

57
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,661
That's telling us that the ball speed

58
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,587
is no longer constant.

59
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,503
The slope of the line
is telling us how fast

60
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,616
the ball's speed is changing.

61
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,541
Just like we plotted
the change in position

62
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,043
to get the ball speed,

63
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,360
we can plot the change in speed

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,762
to get acceleration of the ball.

65
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:16,633
Here is the plot of
the ball's acceleration

66
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,473
versus time.

67
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,479
Notice it is a straight line which means

68
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,739
the acceleration isn't changing

69
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,959
and that's because the acceleration

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,994
due to gravity is constant.

71
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:28,102
To summarize, speed is
the slope of the ball's

72
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,025
position versus time curve.

73
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,550
Similarly, acceleration is the slope

74
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,122
of the speed versus time curve.

75
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,846
As shown in these equations,

76
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:38,819
speed is equal to change in position

77
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,495
divided by change in time.

78
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,149
And acceleration is
equal to change in speed

79
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,842
divided by change in time.

80
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,222
But let's pause here.

81
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:47,389
In the next exercise,

82
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:48,596
we'll challenge you to think about

83
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,785
how the motion of
objects changes over time

84
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:54,000
in terms of position,
speed and acceleration. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
