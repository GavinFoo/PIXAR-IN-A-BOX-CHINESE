00:00:00,541 --> 00:00:03,744
(metal clanging)

3
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:05,565
- We finished going over the first of three things

4
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,152
you need to create a particle simulator.

5
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:10,288
We have formulas that describe how particles will move

6
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:12,349
based on the laws of physics.

7
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,201
In this video, we'll develop formulas

8
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:17,127
that describe how particles will behave during collisions.

9
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:19,223
If velocity is perpendicular to the floor

10
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:20,615
at the moment of collision,

11
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,263
and the collision is perfect,

12
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:24,347
then the velocity reverses.

13
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,983
In the real world, its direction reverses,

14
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,848
and the magnitude is slightly reduced

15
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:30,305
due to friction.

16
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,952
As we introduced in lesson one,

17
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,337
we can model the frictional losses

18
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,027
by multiplying by a factor that measures

19
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:37,355
the elasticity of the collision.

20
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,236
So if V is the downward velocity

21
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:40,929
before the collision with the floor,

22
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,799
then the velocity, called V prime,

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,335
after the collision is given by

24
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:47,767
V prime is equal to negative E

25
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:48,820
times V.

26
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,597
Here E is the elasticity,

27
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:52,605
a number between zero and one,

28
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:55,158
and the minus sign indicates the direction reverses

29
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:56,582
after the collision.

30
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:57,864
If E equals one,

31
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,030
the collision is perfect,

32
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,686
and no energy is lost.

33
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,102
If E is less than one,

34
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:04,604
then some energy will be lost,

35
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:07,245
but what if the velocity makes an angle with the floor.

36
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:10,345
Let's observe what happens on video.

37
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,440
Notice that the ball bounces just like a light ray

38
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,584
reflects off a mirror.

39
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:17,031
That is, if the incoming velocity V

40
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,949
makes an angle Theta with the floor,

41
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,168
then the outgoing velocity called V prime

42
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,111
makes the same angle.

43
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,881
To compute V prime from V,

44
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,263
let's write V as the sum of two vectors,

45
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:30,191
a velocity parallel to the floor, V parallel,

46
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,406
and the velocity perpendicular to the floor,

47
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,310
V perpendicular.

48
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,556
The only force during the collision is perpendicular

49
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,632
to the floor because the floor pushes up on the ball.

50
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,590
So the parallel component won't change,

51
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,492
and the perpendicular component, as before,

52
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:45,233
will be reversed,

53
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:48,181
meaning that V prime is equal V parallel

54
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,650
minus V perpendicular.

55
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,888
Adding elasticity into the mix,

56
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:55,049
we get this equation.

57
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,871
Cool, we can use the idea of writing the velocity

58
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,563
as the sum of parallel and perpendicular components

59
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:05,322
to study the case when two particles I and J

60
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:07,458
of the same mass collide.

61
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,782
Let's draw a picture to make this clear.

62
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:12,229
The line I, J from the center of particle I

63
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,901
to the center of particle J

64
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,145
plays the role of the perpendicular to the floor.

65
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,495
(bell dinging)

66
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,022
So we write V, I as a sum of two vectors,

67
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:21,184
as shown here.

68
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,823
We can do the same for V, J.

69
00:02:26,823 --> 00:02:28,460
The only force acting on the particles

70
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,226
during the collision is along the line I, J.

71
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,968
As before, since no force is acting

72
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,583
in the parallel direction,

73
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:39,229
the velocities in the parallel directions won't change.

74
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,720
To figure out exactly what happens

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,967
in the perpendicular direction

76
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,178
requires using more advanced topics,

77
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:46,769
namely, conservation of energy and momentum.

78
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,245
(chiming)

79
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:52,533
If we apply those concepts

80
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,728
and assume that the particles have the same mass,

81
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:58,483
we find that particle I gets J's perpendicular velocity,

82
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:00,104
and vice versa.

83
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:02,634
That is, they swap perpendicular velocities.

84
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:03,822
(bell chiming)

85
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,282
That means after the collision,

86
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:08,497
the velocities V prime I and V prime J

87
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,245
are given by these equations.

88
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,883
That's it for particle collisions.

89
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:16,114
In the next exercise,

90
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,992
you'll have a chance to review these equations,

91
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,584
which describe collisions.

92
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,000
