00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:05,611
- The final step to complete
our particle simulator

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:06,634
is to develop a method

4
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:09,412
to track particle motions forward in time.

5
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:11,505
That's how our computer
program will animate them.

6
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:13,395
One frame at a time.

7
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:14,859
We said earlier that if you know

8
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,366
the equation of motion of each particle,

9
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,720
then you can compute the
velocities and positions from it.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,271
But how exactly?

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,612
To answer that question,

12
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:24,382
let's go back to the idea of velocity

13
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:28,310
as the slope of the
position versus time curve.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,651
Put two values of time,

15
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:31,751
t one and t two, close together,

16
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,287
and let p one be the
position at time t one

17
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:37,996
and let p two be the
position at time t two.

18
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,680
The slope of the line l,

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,450
shown here, is a good approximation

20
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,567
of the velocity v one at time t one.

21
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,568
The closer that t two gets to t one,

22
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:49,263
the better the approximation.

23
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:51,070
As an equation, the slope of l,

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,907
that is the velocity v one,

25
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:54,934
is given by the change in position divided

26
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:57,266
by the change in time.

27
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,926
If we know the position
and velocity at time t one,

28
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,601
then we can compute the
position in time t two

29
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:06,811
by rearranging this
equation to solve for p two.

30
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,121
Great. So knowing the
particle's position and velocity

31
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,708
at time t one, we can compute
the position at time t two

32
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,659
using this formula.

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,099
But how do we get the
velocity at time t two?

34
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,733
Well, if we know the equation of motion,

35
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,607
then we can compute the
acceleration at time t two.

36
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,211
For instance, if the particle

37
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,614
is just being acted on by gravity,

38
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:30,405
then the acceleration is constant,

39
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:33,156
and is given by the
gravitation constant g.

40
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:35,120
We also know that the acceleration

41
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,752
is the slope of the
velocity versus time curve,

42
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:40,174
meaning gravity equals
a change in velocity

43
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:43,480
divided by the change in time.

44
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,565
And we can solve this for v two.

45
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,654
Now that we know p two and v two,

46
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:49,905
we can repeat this process

47
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,909
to compute p three and v three

48
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,149
and so on, for as long as we like.

49
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,788
Let's do an example.

50
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:57,557
Suppose that at the
start of the simulation,

51
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:59,894
we set our time parameter t to 0,

52
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:03,242
our particle is at point p
one with velocity at v one,

53
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:06,015
and the gravity vector g points down.

54
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:07,199
To figure out where the particle will be

55
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:09,569
at time t equals one half,

56
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,621
we use the equation p
two is equal to v one

57
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:16,679
times the quantity t two
minus t one plus p one,

58
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,235
where t one is equal to zero
and t two is equal to one half.

59
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:25,407
So, p two is equal to one
half v one plus p one.

60
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:30,163
Meaning that p two is halfway
between v one's tail and head.

61
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,444
And to figure out v two,

62
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:34,179
we use v two is equal to g

63
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:38,794
times the quantity t two
minus t one plus v one.

64
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:41,990
G here is the gravitational
vector which points downward,

65
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,734
and on Earth, has a magnitude

66
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,985
of 9.8 meters per second squared.

67
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:50,088
Again, t two minus t one is one half,

68
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:53,961
so v two is equal to
one half g plus v one.

69
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,270
Great. Now we can compute

70
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,674
the position and velocity at t equals one

71
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:00,758
using the same formulas.

72
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,960
Although this is rather
tedious to do by hand,

73
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,262
it is relatively easy to
write a computer program

74
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,184
to do these calculations for us.

75
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:08,919
Like this.

76
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,020
Congratulations.

77
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,525
We now have all the parts we need

78
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,208
to create a ping pong ball simulator.

79
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,906
(chimes)

80
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,020
In the final exercise,

81
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,394
you can test your understanding

82
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,229
of these concepts before moving on

83
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,000
to create your own amazing
particle simulations. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
