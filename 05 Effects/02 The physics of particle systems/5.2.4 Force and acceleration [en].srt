00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:04,361
- Welcome back.

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:06,777
So now we know if a net force is acting on a particle

4
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:08,947
then it will accelerate in that direction.

5
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:10,818
By how much will it accelerate?

6
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:12,971
To answer the question of how force and acceleration

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,746
are related, Newton observed that if you increase

8
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:18,088
the net force by, say, a factor of two,

9
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:21,446
then the acceleration increases by that same factor.

10
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:23,716
This means that force and acceleration

11
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,694
are proportional to one another.

12
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:27,407
But that's not all that matters.

13
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:30,427
Next, let's consider the mass of our particle.

14
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:32,621
Imagine we have two particles floating in space,

15
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:35,460
which are the same size but have different masses,

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,206
like if one is a ping pong ball

17
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:39,358
and the other is made of lead.

18
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,543
If we applied an equal force, like wind,

19
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:44,825
to both particles, what would happen?

20
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49,424
Both particles would experience the same net force

21
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,063
in the direction of the wind,

22
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,879
but they wouldn't accelerate at the same rate.

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,076
The less massive particle, the ping pong ball,

24
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:59,225
would accelerate faster than the one made of lead.

25
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,930
So less mass results in more acceleration

26
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,965
and more mass results in less acceleration,

27
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,858
meaning that mass and acceleration

28
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,977
are inversely proportional to one another.

29
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,626
And we already know that acceleration

30
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:13,706
is proportional to force.

31
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,140
Putting these together we see that

32
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,914
acceleration depends on the magnitude of net force,

33
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:20,045
which is proportional to acceleration,

34
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,459
and the mass of the object,

35
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,259
which is inversely proportional to acceleration.

36
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,380
This gives us a is proportional to f divided by m.

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,534
Multiplying both sides by m gives

38
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:33,958
m times a is proportional to f.

39
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:39,246
And if we flip this, we get f is proportional to m times a.

40
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:43,175
Newton found that f isn't just proportional to ma,

41
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,343
it's in fact equal to ma.

42
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:49,517
This is Newton's second law, f equals ma.

43
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:52,568
To recap, f is the net force acting on the particle,

44
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:54,108
m is the mass of the particle,

45
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:56,773
and a is the acceleration of the particle.

46
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:58,918
Now let's consider the force of gravity.

47
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,680
You made have heard of the famous story

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,541
about Galileo's experiment in 1589,

49
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,767
where he dropped two balls off the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

50
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,324
One was made of a light material,

51
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:10,070
the other a heavy material.

52
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,841
You might be surprised to know that he observed

53
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:15,330
that the two balls accelerated at exactly the same rate.

54
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,044
That blew everyone away.

55
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:20,115
At the time, everybody, starting with the ancient Greeks,

56
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:22,157
just assumed that heavier objects

57
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:23,894
fell faster than lighter objects.

58
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,982
So unlike wind, the force of gravity

59
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:27,984
seems to be independent of mass.

60
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,307
The interesting question is why.

61
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,764
Newton gave us the answer.

62
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:34,220
His first law of gravity said that more massive objects

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,322
experience greater gravitational force

64
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,016
and his second law says

65
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,577
that mass is a resistance to acceleration.

66
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,461
These two competing trends, one encouraging acceleration

67
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,371
and one resisting it, cancel each other out.

68
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:48,105
To see why this happens mathematically,

69
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:51,572
Newton theorized that force due to gravity, call it big F,

70
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,404
is proportional to the mass of the particle.

71
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:56,965
Big F is proportional to ma.

72
00:02:56,965 --> 00:03:00,459
Think of gravity as an acceleration vector, call it g,

73
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,377
such that big F is equal to mg.

74
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:04,898
So we have two equations.

75
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:08,607
Newton's second law, little f is equal to ma

76
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:10,514
where little f is the net force

77
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:14,767
and Newton's law of gravity where big F is equal to mg.

78
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:18,443
For a particle being acted on by only gravity,

79
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:21,931
the net force little f is big F.

80
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:26,206
Little f is equal to mg is equal to big F is equal to ma.

81
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,532
Or more simply, mg is equal to ma.

82
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:36,323
Notice the m cancels, leaving just g is equal to a.

83
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:38,081
That is, the acceleration of a particle,

84
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,973
when acted on only by gravity,

85
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:42,336
is independent of the mass of the particle.

86
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:45,738
This is why objects of different mass fall at the same rate.

87
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,507
An equation like this one, that allows us

88
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,523
to compute the acceleration of particles,

89
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,651
is called an equation of motion.

90
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:52,866
We've covered a bunch of new

91
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,690
and important concepts in this video.

92
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,372
So let's stop here for some practice,

93
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,000
using the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
