00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:03,469
(bouncing)

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,372
- Sir Isaac Newton famously observed

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,391
that objects at rest stay at rest

5
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:10,208
unless they're acted on by a force.

6
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:13,331
And objects which are in motion
have an unchanging velocity.

7
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:15,903
For example, a particle
floating through empty space

8
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,498
would never stop.

9
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:19,189
So whether a particle is motionless

10
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,487
or traveling at a constant velocity,

11
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:23,581
if no forces are applied to the particle,

12
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,916
then no change in velocity occurs.

13
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,515
That's called Newton's First Law.

14
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:30,102
In order to accelerate our particle,

15
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:31,716
that is, to change its velocity,

16
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:33,904
a net force must be applied.

17
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:37,432
As with velocity and acceleration,
forces are also vectors.

18
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:40,666
The force due to gravity for
instance, will point downward,

19
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,313
and its length will depend on
how much gravity is present.

20
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,478
If this gravitational
force is the only force

21
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:49,253
acting on the particle, then
its velocity will change,

22
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:50,820
meaning it will accelerate
in the direction

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,810
of the force vector.

24
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,151
But what if there are multiple forces

25
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,644
at work on the particle?

26
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:58,922
Like if I add a wind force
in addition to gravity.

27
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:01,731
Suppose for instance, that the
wind is blowing to the right

28
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,861
half as strongly as the force
of gravity pointing downward.

29
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,300
We need to add these forces
together using vector addition

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,715
to determine the net force.

31
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:12,239
Written as an equation, net force is equal

32
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,197
to gravity plus wind.

33
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:17,063
Since the net force is now
pointing down and to the right,

34
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,696
that also dictates the direction that

35
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,430
that particle will accelerate.

36
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,066
If there are more forces at work,

37
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:26,206
we would add those forces all
up to determine the net force.

38
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,733
And that would determine the direction

39
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,735
the particle would accelerate.

40
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:33,690
For instance, suppose the
particle is sitting on a table.

41
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,693
Gravity is pulling the particle downward,

42
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:37,058
and the wind is pushing the particle

43
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,800
to the right, as before.

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,592
But there's another force at
work on the particle, too.

45
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:44,529
The table is pushing up on the
particle to resist gravity.

46
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:47,105
So our force diagram looks like this.

47
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,955
The forces of gravity and the
table, cancel each other out,

48
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:52,858
leaving the wind force as a net force.

49
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:55,429
Okay, in the next exercise
you'll get some practice

50
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:56,729
working with net forces.
