00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,532
(bouncing)

3
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:04,716
- As we mentioned earlier,

4
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:07,135
particle systems can be used for more than water.

5
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:09,384
Lots of other effects can be created with them.

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,540
Like fireworks, for example.

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,370
(explosions)

8
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,429
To see how that works,

9
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,310
let's start by launching a few particles

10
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,168
under the influence of gravity.

11
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:18,751
When they reach the top of their arc,

12
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,015
they explode to create other particles.

13
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:23,951
We'll call these child particles.

14
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:27,251
You can vary the strength of gravity using this slider.

15
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:30,219
A large value keeps the particles from rising very high,

16
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,429
and a small value causes particles to fly off the screen.

17
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:35,638
Notice that the child particles

18
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,743
disappear after a short time.

19
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,177
This is called their lifetime.

20
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:43,934
We can vary the lifetime using this slider.

21
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,222
Let's also increase the number of

22
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,706
child particles that get created.

23
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,291
To create something more believable,

24
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,907
let's add some randomness.

25
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:55,186
For instance, let's add some random variation

26
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:57,904
to the speed of the child particles.

27
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:58,921
That's better.

28
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,719
Let's also add some variation to the angle

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,925
at which the initial particles get launched.

30
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:04,349
Awesome.

31
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,371
See what kind of fireworks display you can create

32
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,031
in the next exercise.

33
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:14,679
(explosions)
(whistling)

34
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:17,637
And in the next lesson,

35
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:18,470
we'll look more closely

36
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,288
at the physics underlying the ping pong ball simulator,

37
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:22,330
which you'll need to understand

38
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,040
if you want to code up your own simulator from scratch.
