00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:03,212
(bouncing)

3
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,911
- In the last video, we saw this preview

4
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,237
of a shot from Finding Nemo

5
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:08,013
where we've drawn the particles as balls

6
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:10,179
to illustrate their motion.

7
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,287
For the final shot, we
used the particle positions

8
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:13,668
to compute a surface.

9
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:17,791
Then we rendered that surface
to look more like water.

10
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,648
To draw a smooth surface
using individual particles,

11
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,341
we use an analogy involving heat.

12
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:28,117
First, imagine these
particles are little heaters.

13
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:29,742
Next, pretend we have a thermometer

14
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:32,923
which tells us the temperature
at any point in space.

15
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:36,400
For example, the particles
might be exactly 1,000 degrees,

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,135
and as we move away, things cooled down.

17
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,360
Let's say this point over
here is exactly 100 degrees,

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,860
and there isn't just one point in space

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,310
which is 100 degrees, but many points.

20
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,136
So if we connect all points
where the thermometer

21
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:51,851
says 100 degrees, we get a
curve shown here in yellow.

22
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,216
And that's the trick.

23
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,910
Now we can fill in this yellow
curve with a solid blue color

24
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,084
to give us something that looks
more like a puddle of water.

25
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,652
If the particles are far apart,

26
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:04,327
they each form their own
isolated region, like a droplet.

27
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:06,858
As they get closer, the
droplets start to glob together,

28
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,373
mimicking real water.

29
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:10,316
Here's a version with
a few more particles.

30
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:12,151
This is starting to look like water.

31
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,522
It would really look like water

32
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:16,297
if we had a few thousand particles.

33
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:18,758
For use in our movies, we
work in three dimensions,

34
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,639
and the curve becomes a surface

35
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,565
like in this shot from Finding Dory,

36
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:24,482
or in this more extreme water simulation

37
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:26,983
also from Finding Dory.

38
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:33,590
Here's an example from
Monsters University.

39
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,999
Here we're simulating
paint, instead of water.

40
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,282
We've turned up the viscosity

41
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:40,324
since paint is more viscous than water.

42
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:42,197
We weren't exactly sure
how paint would behave

43
00:01:42,197 --> 00:01:44,527
so one of the first things
we did to create this shot

44
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:47,145
is to videotape reference of real paint.

45
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,377
The reference really helped
us create a believable look.

46
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,787
Let's pause here so you can practice

47
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,298
using the next exercise.

48
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:54,131
Good luck.

49
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,000
