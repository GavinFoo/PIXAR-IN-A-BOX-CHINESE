2
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:03,489
(springy bounce)

3
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:04,577
- Hey, welcome back.

4
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:06,817
You probably noticed that the ping pong ball stimulator

5
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,421
looks a little more like sand than water.

6
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:13,562
For instance, the balls can pile up on each other like this.

7
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:16,540
We used a stimulation much like this in Finding Dory.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,490
For instance, the sand in this shot.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,354
And the East Australian current in this shot.

10
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:24,263
To create more water-like stimulation,

11
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:26,903
we need to remove the hard boundary of the balls.

12
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:28,872
They don't just bounce off like ping pong balls.

13
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:32,181
They kind of smush together to create a soft collision.

14
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:34,310
The smooth collisions are an approximation

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,845
of the pressure forces that water normally experiences.

16
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:40,355
There's a fancy name for this kind of stimulation.

17
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,784
It's called "smoothed particle hydrodynamics"

18
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:44,752
or "SPH" for short.

19
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:48,164
Hydrodynamics literally means the motion of fluids.

20
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:52,684
Now let's look at how lots of smooth particles interact.

21
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:56,476
We can control how the particles collide

22
00:00:56,476 --> 00:01:00,326
using this parameter called Collision softness.

23
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:05,315
Okay, so this is getting pretty close.

24
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,711
Another parameter we can control is called Viscosity.

25
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:12,003
Viscosity is a measure of how easily things flow.

26
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:13,914
Fluids with low viscosity like water,

27
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,581
flow pretty freely as we see here.

28
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:20,970
Fluids with high viscosity like honey, flow more slowly.

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,489
Like this.

30
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,739
(water rippling)

31
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,562
The more particles you add, the more computation is needed

32
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:33,617
and the slower the program responds.

33
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:45,031
(slow motion water ripple)

34
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,534
Here's an example of SPH from Finding Nemo.

35
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:50,587
It takes place inside the mouth of a whale.

36
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:52,214
We've drawn the particles as balls here

37
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:54,554
so you can watch their motion.

38
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,793
In the next exercise, you'll get some practice

39
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,787
experimenting with these different parameters

40
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,739
to get a wide range of behaviors.

41
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:03,000
