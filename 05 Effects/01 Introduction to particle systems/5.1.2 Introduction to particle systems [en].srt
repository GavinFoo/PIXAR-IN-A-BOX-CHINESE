PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,827
- Hi, I'm Matt Wong, an Effects Technical Director

3
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:07,247
here at Pixar.

4
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:08,910
I work with Sara Beth and Eric who you met

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,790
in the previous video and this is the pool they were in,

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,790
the Pixar Pool, which is one of the nice perks

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,902
of working here at Pixar.

8
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:17,620
We don't just use the pool for recreation,

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,441
we sometimes use it for work, too

10
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:21,969
like in this reference video we shot for Finding Dory.

11
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,918
We wanted to see what it would look like underwater

12
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:27,335
when large objects like this pumpkin hit the water.

13
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:29,283
In the previous video you learned that water

14
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:32,129
and other physically phenomena like smoke, dust,

15
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:34,734
and fire can be simulated using lots and lots

16
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,236
of individual particles.

17
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:39,204
Using particles is a simplification of real physics

18
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,072
but it's an effective tool for artists.

19
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,415
The more particles you use

20
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:44,485
the closer you get to real physics.

21
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,002
Most of our simulations require millions and millions

22
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,518
of particles to create believable water.

23
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:51,975
Keeping track of that many particles would take too long

24
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,198
for humans to do.

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,881
Even computers have trouble with large particle counts

26
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,874
but we've developed some practical methods

27
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,742
that you'll learn about in this lesson.

28
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:01,488
One of the most power techniques we use

29
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:03,308
is called a particle system.

30
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:08,079
Particle systems were first invented by an effects artist

31
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,079
named Bill Reeves to create a shot for the movie

32
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:10,590
Start Trek Two back in 1982.

33
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,342
The shot was called the Genesis Effect

34
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:13,843
and it blew people away.

35
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:16,364
It was a real milestone in computer graphics.

36
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,641
At the time Bill was working for a group

37
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,018
that eventually became Pixar.

38
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:22,459
And you know what, he still works here.

39
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,293
Hey Bill.

40
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:24,165
- Hey.

41
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:25,107
- Can you tell us a little bit more

42
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:26,369
about the Genesis Effect?

43
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,037
Like what was the story point?

44
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:31,427
- Well the Genesis Effect was this device

45
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:36,449
that could turn a living planet into a dead planet

46
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:40,812
or a dead planet into a living planet and I used

47
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:45,675
particle systems to do the transformational fire element

48
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,215
at that.

49
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:48,345
- And today we still use particles

50
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:49,976
for lots of different effects.

51
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,494
In the rest of the lesson you'll learn how we use particles

52
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:53,917
to simulate the motion of water

53
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:56,000
and you'll create a fireworks show. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
