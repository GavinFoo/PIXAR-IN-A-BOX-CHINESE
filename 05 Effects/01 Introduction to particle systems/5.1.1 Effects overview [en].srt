PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,840
 Hello! I'm Eric and I am an effects artist at Pixar. 

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,300
 And I'm Sara Beth, another Pixar effects artist. 

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,900
 Pixar called "effects" to the creation and animation of anything that moves 

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,280
 but that is not a character. 

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,780
 Almost all natural phenomena in our films are created by teams of effects. 

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,220
 Things like dust 

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,320
 (cough) 

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,900
 Smoke! 

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,560
 (cough) 

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,920
 Fire 

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,900
 (cough) 

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,600
 explosions 

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,760

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,860
 Do not 

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,560
 (Sound of explosion) 

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,440
 and effects created water is its different forms. 

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,740
 Computer make credible water is very exciting and a challenge 

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,800
 this is partly because water takes many forms: 

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,700
 the placid lake where you can swim, 

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,200
 or pounding river would not want to catch you. 

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,800
 The type of water we create depends on the story we want to tell 

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 and how we approach the water is different depending on how you interact with characters 

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
 and how close we are to them. 

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,500
 One of the tools we use to create believable water on the computer are particles. 

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,060
 We begin with a single particle. 

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,000
 We can apply forces to the particle such as wind or gravity 

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,860
 or more particles that push and pull each other. 

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,019
 Adding many, many, many more particles 

30
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,760
 and applying those same forces 

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,319
 water started to create on the computer. 

32
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,500
 The water in the real world is also made of particles 

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 because the molecules are just tiny particles 

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,180
 and although our particles are much, much larger than the molecules 

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,739
 physics is similar, so we simulate 

36
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,340
 those forces using real world math and code. 

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,380
 It takes years and years to encourage individually 

38
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,780
 the millions of particles that make water into scenes, 

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,300
 so it helps that we can use an existing set of rules 

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,560
 they can follow the particles on the computer. 

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,500
 You might be probably wondering how I can make water for animated films. 

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,720
 Sara Beth Good question! 

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,239
 In the following lessons you will learn all about how to create particles and water using simulation. 

44
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,000
 Have fun and remain dry!  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
