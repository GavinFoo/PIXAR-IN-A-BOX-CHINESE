00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:01,661
(bell dinging)

3
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:04,253
- As a kid my interests were sports.

4
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:07,344
I loved playing outside, but more academically,

5
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:09,051
I love math and science.

6
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,811
One year for Christmas, my mom and dad

7
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,112
got me a chemistry set and I went wild with it.

8
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:16,109
I almost lit the house on fire.

9
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:20,317
My first film here at Pixar was Partly Cloudy.

10
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:23,324
It was a short film, directed by Pete Sohn.

11
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,693
The cloud characters were originally

12
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:27,485
hard surface characters, but we used particles

13
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,077
to turn them in to fluffy cloud characters.

14
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:32,017
The thing I like most about being an effects artist

15
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:33,103
is the variety.

16
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:36,990
I get to do water, fire, fireworks, smoke, dust.

17
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,392
It's a little bit of everything.

18
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:41,023
In effects we always work in teams.

19
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,100
We split up the work into various shots,

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,449
but we're always looking at each other's work,

21
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,051
comparing each other's techniques,

22
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:49,833
solutions to problems.

23
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,585
It's a very collaborative effort.

24
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,890
We give and take from each other,

25
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,623
and we kinda try to match the look

26
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,220
amongst the entire team.

27
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,137
In effects, we usually deal with big hard problems.

28
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:03,206
We almost always get it wrong the first time,

29
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:05,395
the second time, and the third time.

30
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,977
We do things over and over and over again,

31
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:08,822
until we get them right.

32
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,684
For some of the most difficult shots,

33
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:14,375
I must have done it at least 15, 20 times

34
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,913
before I got it right.

35
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:18,866
And even then it maybe needed a few more iterations

36
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:20,000
to get it exactly right. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
