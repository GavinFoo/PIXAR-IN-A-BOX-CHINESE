2
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:03,247
(bouncing)

3
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:05,135
- Okay, let's dive into
the use of particles

4
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:06,268
for simulating water.

5
00:00:06,268 --> 00:00:08,869
(water splashing)

6
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:10,922
Before talking about how
lots of particles move,

7
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:13,983
let's start by looking at
how one particle moves.

8
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:16,026
If I drop a particle, or a ping pong ball,

9
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:17,873
it accelerates towards the ground.

10
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:21,994
We also saw this kind of
motion in the animation topic.

11
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:23,694
Notice that it bounces back up,

12
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:25,628
but not quite as high as it started.

13
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:27,700
It loses some energy during the bounce,

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,392
and eventually when it loses
all of its energy, it stops.

15
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:34,067
Now let's look at our
ping pong ball simuator

16
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:37,575
where we model each ping pong
ball using a virtual particle.

17
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,380
The virtual particle accelerates downward

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,733
until it hits an obstacle,

19
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:44,306
and then it bounces back up,
only with a little less energy.

20
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:46,444
With this simulator,
we can control how big

21
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:49,566
the particle is using this slider.

22
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:51,867
We can also control how strong

23
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:54,670
the gravity is using this slider.

24
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,917
A small gravitational value
similar to the gravity

25
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,780
found on the moon causes the particle

26
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,368
to fall more gradually.

27
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:03,947
A larger gravitational value,

28
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,321
like the gravity here on Earth,

29
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:09,792
causes the particle to fall
at a more familiar rate.

30
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,113
And sending it to a very
large gravitational value,

31
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:16,381
like on Jupiter, makes the
particle fall really quickly.

32
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,773
We can also control how much
energy the particle loses

33
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:21,634
during a bounce, by
controlling its elasticity.

34
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:22,904
It describes a fraction of energy

35
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:26,280
that is retained when
the particle bounces.

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,803
Elasticity is a number
between zero and one.

37
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:34,307
A value of one means the
particle loses no energy.

38
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,211
It'll bounce forever.

39
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:38,248
This is called perfect elastic collision,

40
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,962
and it's something that
doesn't happen in real life.

41
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:43,751
A value of zero means the
particle loses all of its energy.

42
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,852
In this case, sticking to the floor.

43
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:50,369
Intermediate values give the
particle more realistic motion.

44
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,923
Elasticity is also used
to control the energy loss

45
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:55,331
when particles hit each other.

46
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,246
If we set elasticity to zero,
then the particles will lose

47
00:01:58,246 --> 00:01:59,849
all energy when they collide.

48
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,920
Like this, similar to a pile of marbles.

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,925
And as we increase the elasticity,

50
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:11,574
we get something that looks
more like rubber balls.

51
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,090
And of course, you can also change

52
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,380
the size of the particles.

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,547
Let's pause here so you
can use the next exercise

54
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,805
to get some experience with
the range of particle behavior

55
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,014
you can achieve by
changing the particle size,

56
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:25,127
gravity, and elasticity.

57
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,000
