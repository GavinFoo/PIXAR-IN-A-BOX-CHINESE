00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,800
(lamp clatters)

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,031
- Great work making it this far.

4
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:06,957
Now it's your turn to drive.

5
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:10,246
So far we've built a
two-dimensional mass spring system.

6
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,457
It's pretty cool, it's the key

7
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:14,862
building block for many simulations.

8
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,236
Recall in lesson one we
used multiple springs

9
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:19,625
connected together like
this to model hair.

10
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,415
In this video I'm going to show you how

11
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:24,141
to add a second spring
and mass to your system.

12
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:26,525
First let's draw a new force diagram

13
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,269
to see what's going on.

14
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,090
Let's call our two
masses mass 1 and mass 2,

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,574
and our two springs spring 1 and spring 2.

16
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:37,391
First let's think about the new forces

17
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,178
acting on mass 1, as before,

18
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:42,368
we have the gravity force acting downward,

19
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:45,584
a spring 1 force pulling
up towards the anchor,

20
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:48,638
and a damping force acting
in the opposite direction.

21
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:50,912
However, now there is a new force

22
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:53,435
due to the new spring connecting mass 2.

23
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:55,532
In this case the displacement we use

24
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,642
to calculate spring to
force is the difference

25
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:02,411
between both masses, mass 2
position minus mass 1 position,

26
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,063
and there is also a damping force

27
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:07,498
resisting the spring 2 force.

28
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:10,509
So we need to add these two
new forces to the x and y

29
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,766
components of the mass
1 net force calculation.

30
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:16,778
Now consider the new mass we've added.

31
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:19,261
It will experience the force of gravity

32
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,640
as well as a spring 2 force minus

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,657
the opposing spring 2 damping force.

34
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:27,519
That's it for modifying
our force calculation.

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,849
At the top we'll need
new initial variables

36
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,058
to represent both the position
and velocity of mass 2.

37
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:35,687
I'll set the initial position of mass 2

38
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,797
so that it's below mass 1.

39
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,290
The initial velocity of
mass 2 is zero as well.

40
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,397
To add a new mass 2 we have to double up

41
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,438
all of our equations used for mass 1.

42
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,067
However, there are two key differences.

43
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,093
For the mass 2 spring force calculations

44
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,658
we'll use mass2Position
minus mass1Position

45
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,232
as our displacement.

46
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:01,528
And for the mass 2 net force calculations,

47
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:05,180
we have mass2SpringForce
minus mass2DampingForce.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,895
Finally, we just need
to draw the new circle

49
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:12,549
and line for this mass and spring.

50
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,614
The new line will extend
from mass 1 to mass 2.

51
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:18,756
The new circle will be the
center of mass 2's position,

52
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,782
and that gives us this.

53
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,253
Mass spring systems are really powerful.

54
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,700
At Pixar we don't just use them for hair.

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,752
The trees in The Good Dinosaur

56
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:31,021
were also simulated with
a mass spring system.

57
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,878
Kind of similar to hair, but it had

58
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:34,936
to represent a tree structure.

59
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:37,351
Trees have branches, so we simulated them

60
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:40,410
by having multiple line
segments attached to each other

61
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,151
kind of like having
hairs attached to hairs

62
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:45,774
instead of only being
attached to the scalp.

63
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:48,750
Even clothing is simulated
using masses and springs.

64
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,670
In Brave, Merida had several
garments that we needed

65
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,666
to simulate, and each garment
had their own spring values.

66
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,974
These values were chosen
to mimic different

67
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:01,645
kinds of cloth, such as
wool, cotton, and satin.

68
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:04,791
As you can see, mass spring
systems are super useful

69
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,913
for modifying and simulating
all kinds of different things.

70
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:09,912
See if you can think of other materials

71
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:12,705
that could be created
using mass spring systems.

72
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:14,859
And that's the goal of this final project.

73
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:16,587
Your job is to modify this program

74
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,437
to make whatever you can dream up.

75
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,670
The program you spin off
will automatically show up

76
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,704
below under the Spin-offs tab,

77
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,834
along with everyone else's.

78
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,624
And I really encourage you
to check out other creations

79
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,036
to get new ideas for inspiration.

80
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:32,000
Have fun, and happy exploring. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
