PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:05,803
- We actually do a lot
of simulation at Pixar.

3
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,416
Things like fire, water, and explosions

4
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:09,373
are handled by the effects department.

5
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:13,731
You can learn more about
that in the effects lesson.

6
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:17,477
The simulation department,
who I work with,

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:20,732
handles any motion attached
to the characters at Pixar,

8
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,320
like clothing and hair.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,660
But we can't move every hair

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,836
on a Pixar character's head by hand,

11
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:28,036
that would drive our animators crazy.

12
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:30,360
Instead, we use Physics
and Computer Programming.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,932
In this lesson, you'll learn how to

14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,349
simulate hair the same
way we did for Merida

15
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,058
in the movie "Brave".

16
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,429
Here is an example of a shot of Merida

17
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,168
that the simulation department got

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,498
from the animation department

19
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,397
on the film "Brave".

20
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,658
The animators have created
the main action in the scene

21
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,008
and now it's our job to
fill in the missing details

22
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,486
such as the motion of cloth and hair.

23
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,673
Everything we do begins
with modeling the problem

24
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,131
we want to solve.

25
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,018
In this case, we need a physical model

26
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:57,748
of Merida's curly hair.

27
00:00:57,748 --> 00:01:00,088
So let's begin with the very basics.

28
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:02,498
What should our model of hair look like?

29
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:05,165
Well, hair is kind of like a mop,

30
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,203
just a bunch of strings.

31
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:09,794
But strings are actually quite complex

32
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,671
to model mathematically
because they are so bendy.

33
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,895
Modeling them requires a
lot of computational power

34
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,082
due to all the calculations involved.

35
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:18,947
This is why we are always looking for ways

36
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,499
to simplify our models.

37
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,937
For example, we could take
a bunch of paper clips

38
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:24,736
to model a strand of hair.

39
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,950
We first draw a series of line segments

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,060
connected to particles, like this.

41
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,070
The computer needs to
calculate the positions

42
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,617
of these particles.

43
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:34,545
But first we need to describe what forces

44
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,262
are acting on them.

45
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,489
In the real world, each
particle is affected

46
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,206
by three forces.

47
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:41,456
The force of gravity,

48
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:45,084
and the forces from neighboring
connections, like this.

49
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:47,072
Next step, I have an interactive program

50
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,153
for you to see this in action.

51
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:51,173
You can adjust the following parameters:

52
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:54,292
size of each segment,
number of segments per hair,

53
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:57,943
number of hairs, and the force of gravity.

54
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:59,670
Explore these parameters to see what kinds

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,242
of looks you can come up with.

56
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,000
Have fun. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
