00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,297
(jumping, bouncing)

3
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:03,265
(light switches on)

4
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:04,098
- Great work.

5
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:05,682
So far we've built up a model of hair

6
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:08,013
using a series of damped springs.

7
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:10,353
This gives us a more realistic behavior,

8
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:12,804
like this style I came up with.

9
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,270
But remember, the art department

10
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,901
wants Merida's hair to be curly.

11
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,640
Sometimes it curls up while moving but it doesn't

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,384
hold that curly shape while at rest.

13
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:25,729
Here's an idea.

14
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,812
What if we put some smaller springs in between

15
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:30,378
the larger springs to pull them together?

16
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,266
Let's call them support springs.

17
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,722
We already have a mathematical model of the spring

18
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:36,645
so this is easy to test out.

19
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,818
If I connect a support spring between the larger

20
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:41,920
springs, I get something like this.

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,414
If I hide the support springs, you'll notice the hair

22
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:47,034
comes to a rest in a curly shape.

23
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,426
That's much better.

24
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,104
Adding these support springs results

25
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:52,675
in new parameters we can control.

26
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,787
The stiffness and length of the support springs.

27
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:59,182
Shorter support springs will give us smaller curls,

28
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:02,453
while really long support springs give us bigger ones.

29
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:05,267
And if we make the support springs have a higher stiffness

30
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,474
the curl pops up like this.

31
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:09,805
Kind of like we applied hairspray.

32
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:12,913
Compare this to support springs with lower stiffness.

33
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:14,839
In this case, the curls relax a bit

34
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,785
and fall downwards in a natural way.

35
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,203
Now, let's try this with a bunch of hairs.

36
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,577
Now that's starting to look more like Merida.

37
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,911
This isn't exactly the method we used on Merida

38
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:27,040
for the movie, but it's close.

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,187
In this next interactive you can try this out

40
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,896
with all the parameters we've introduced.

41
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:35,629
The two new parameters are support spring stiffness

42
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,801
and support spring length.

43
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,000
