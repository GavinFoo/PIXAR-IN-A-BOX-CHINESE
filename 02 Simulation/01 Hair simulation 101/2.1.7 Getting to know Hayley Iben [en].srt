00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:04,312
- When I was young, I
really liked some sports

3
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:07,086
like softball and I was the catcher

4
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:10,923
and the first base player
and I also liked music.

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:14,124
I started playing the
flute in the fourth grade

6
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:17,162
and from there I played in the band

7
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:21,297
and I branched out and
taught myself tenor saxophone

8
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:22,872
and played that in the jazz band

9
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:27,550
and I was in the marching
band and the symphonic band

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,834
and I was a drum major

11
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,850
and lots of different
activities with music.

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,369
It was great.

13
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,967
In high school, there
were some elective classes

14
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:38,703
that we need to take and my
mom was helping me figure out

15
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:40,076
which ones to pick.

16
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:44,875
And she had gone back to
school while I was a kid

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,441
and she had taken a programming class

18
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,434
and she suggested that I took one of those

19
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:53,786
to see if I liked it and
so that's how I got into it

20
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,548
and I already liked computers,
I love playing with them.

21
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:59,525
I remember my parents
getting our first computer.

22
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:00,448
It was an old 286

23
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:05,149
and it was just something that was

24
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,923
at that point a toy but then learning

25
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:10,361
how to program a computer
was really interesting to me

26
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,048
and so I started taking
computer classes in ninth grade

27
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,045
and all through high school.

28
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,453
Yeah, I majored in computer science

29
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,547
in the liberal arts school
and got a Bachelor of Science

30
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,611
and I also did a minor in mathematics.

31
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,215
I got a Master's and
a PhD from UC Berkeley

32
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:32,280
and my Master's was in
computational geometry

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,706
and my thesis was on
physically-based simulation

34
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:42,286
for creating crack patterns on
surfaces so like mud drawing.

35
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:44,024
I also looked at crackle glass

36
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:48,227
and so that's a way to create
crack patterns in class

37
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:53,575
and use that for cups and
bowls and things like that.

38
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,409
In my internship,

39
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,538
I ended up working on an
inverse kinematics problem

40
00:01:57,538 --> 00:02:01,520
with Andy Weken who was my
mentor and the research group.

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,962
Let's pretend I wanna animate my arm

42
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:08,187
and I would wanna grab
my wrist and move it here

43
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:11,076
and what inverse kinematics
does is it would solve

44
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:12,711
to figure out what are the angles

45
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:16,312
that I'd have to move my elbow
joint and my shoulder joint

46
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:19,485
to hit the target which
is where my wrist is.

47
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,877
It's really exciting for me

48
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:23,550
to watch the finished movie for Brave.

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,099
I worked on a lot of the
technology that was used

50
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,204
to animate the characters
and to do the hair simulator.

51
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:32,012
I wrote the inverse kinematic system

52
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:36,113
that was used to move the
horses and move the humans.

53
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,218
I spent a lot of time trying to make sure

54
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:42,241
that posing tool was right and having that

55
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,935
and have Merida's hair
fill up the entire screen

56
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,848
was incredibly satisfying

57
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,587
and to see how beautiful
it all turned out.

58
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,573
And while I was writing those tools,

59
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:54,295
I got scheduled to do an interview

60
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:57,787
with another co-worker
for the simulation group

61
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:00,142
because they were looking
for a new simulation person

62
00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:03,242
and the person who left had done

63
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:05,467
fluids and other types of simulation work

64
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:08,109
that wasn't an area
that I was familiar with

65
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,014
so I hadn't even thought about
this work, this job opening

66
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,033
and I think it had been
open for about a year

67
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,069
when we were talking about it.

68
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,393
They were having a hard
time filling this position

69
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:20,407
and the person we were interviewing

70
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,033
was doing a Master's thesis

71
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:25,161
and he was implementing
some of my PhD thesis

72
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:28,411
and so after the interview,
my co-worker said,

73
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,661
he turned to me and said,

74
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:33,003
"Why aren't you applying for this job?"

75
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:36,127
That was really a point in my career

76
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,388
to really sit and think like,

77
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:40,223
"Huh, why I aren't I
applying for this job?"

78
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:45,086
And so I really gave it some
consideration and decided

79
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,717
and was like, "Yeah, I do
wanna apply for this job."

80
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:50,360
And it's always a little
bit scary when you try to

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,414
do something new but it
was definitely worth it.

82
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:57,268
I didn't listen to the
people that were saying,

83
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:59,928
"Oh, you should be doing this instead,"

84
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:03,179
because you should do
what your heart tells you

85
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:07,000
and even if it's scary, you
should go ahead and do it. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
