2
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:02,883
(bouncy Pixar theme)

3
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:05,428
- In the last exercise you probably noticed
在上一个实例里 你或许会发现

4
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:08,780
that the simulation lacked the natural bounciness of hair.
模拟的结果似乎不太自然 没弹性

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,678
But what makes something look bouncy anyway?
但是怎样才能让它看起来有弹性

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,978
To make this model bouncy, we need each strand of hair
要让这个模拟有弹性

7
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,804
to expand and contract slightly
我们必须让这束头发有轻微的扩张和收缩

8
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,611
when forces are applied to them.
当它们受力后

9
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:21,860
This required a new physical analogy to base our model on,
就需要一个新的物理模型来介入

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,500
so we tried springs.
我们想到了弹簧

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,877
Springs are great because they can change length
弹簧的好处在于在你拉他们的时候

12
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,259
when you pull on them,
他们能伸缩

13
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,986
and to give the hair a little bit of weight,
还能给头发一些重力

14
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,999
we add a small weight to the end of the spring.
我们在弹簧的末尾加了一点重力

15
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,460
This is known as a mass spring system.
这就是重力弹簧系统

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,781
We can actually draw a mathematical model
我们能实际上能建立一个数学模型

17
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:41,161
to explain what happens when a spring expands and contracts.
来解释弹簧伸缩的时候到底在发生什么

18
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,647
The model we use is based on a law developed by Robert Hooke
其实我们这个模型是基于胡克定律（注释1https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BD%97%E4%BC%AF%E7%89%B9%C2%B7%E8%83%A1%E5%85%8B）

19
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,961
a 17th century physicist.
他是一个17世纪的物理学家（其实他有很多身份）

20
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,343
Hooke noticed that there are two things to consider
胡可发现在考虑弹簧伸缩的受力的时候

21
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:51,903
when a spring expands and contracts.
有两样东西要注意

22
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,173
One, if we pull on a spring and it expands,
第一：当我们拉伸弹簧的时候

23
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:58,875
we will increase its length and it will pull back together.
我们会使他延展，而他将产生回力

24
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,541
Two, if the spring contracts, its length will decrease
第二： 当我们压缩弹簧时

25
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,292
and it will push apart.
他会缩短并产生推力

26
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:06,125
How much a spring pushes and pulls
而这个弹簧的推力与拉力

27
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,877
is known as the spring force.
就是所谓的弹力

28
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:11,085
Robert Hooke was looking for relationship
胡克就是在寻找

29
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,503
between the spring force
弹簧的弹力变化

30
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:15,520
in the amount the spring contracts or expands.
何其伸缩长度之间的数学关系

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,735
We call this change in length displacement.
我们把这个称作长度置换

32
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,429
Displacement is defined as the current length
置换量是由现有长度

33
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,749
minus the rest length of the spring.
减去弹簧原长的来决定的

34
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:27,520
When we stretch a spring, the displacement is positive
我们拉伸时 置换是正值

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,046
and the resulting spring force is negative.
弹力就是负值

36
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,775
This is known as the pull force.
这也就是拉力

37
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:36,027
When we compress a spring, the displacement is negative
当我们压缩时 置换是负值

38
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,382
and the resulting spring force is positive.
那弹力就是正值

39
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,392
This is called the push force.
这也就是压力

40
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,292
So Hooke's observation was quite simple,
所以胡克的观察是如此的简单

41
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,530
he noticed that a larger displacement
他发现置换越大

42
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,730
results in a larger force,
力越大

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,681
while a smaller displacement results in a smaller force.
反之则越小

44
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,881
That is, he noticed that the displacement
他因此发现置换和力

45
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,346
is proportional to the force.
是成某种比例的

46
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,486
However, every spring is different,
尽管每个弹簧不同

47
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:01,066
some take a lot of force to displace,
一些需要很大的力来置换

48
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,616
and some are really easy to displace.
而一些则不需要

49
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:07,084
So Robert Hooke introduced the idea of stiffness
所以胡克引入了弹性系数的概念

50
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:10,398
to account for how hard it is to displace a given spring.
用这个值来计算多少力用来置换弹力

51
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,698
It is represented with the letter k.
他的数学符号是k.

52
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,782
This led Hooke to his final equation
这就使胡克写出了最终的方程式

53
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,575
which is known as Hooke's Law.
也就是有名的胡克定律

54
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,374
The spring force is proportional
弹力与弹性系数和置换量

55
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:20,972
to a stiffness times the displacement.
的乘积成线性关系F=-kx

56
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,107
Notice that there is a negative sign there,
注意 这儿有个负号

57
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:25,343
that's because we want a positive force
因为我们定义置换量为负值的时候

58
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:27,169
when the displacement is negative,
能得到正数

59
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,781
and a negative force when it's positive.
反之则是负数

60
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,847
If we plug this equation into the computer
如果我们把这个方程应用到计算机里

61
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,215
we get this realistic spring behavior.
我们就会得到真实的弹簧行为

62
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,935
For Brave, we modeled the horse's hair
在brave里 我们就用重力弹簧模型

63
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:38,507
using a mass spring system
模拟了马的毛发

64
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,318
similar to what we are describing in this tutorial,
和我们在这个教程里差不多

65
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:44,541
nearly 10,000 simulated hairs in total.
有10000根毛发模拟

66
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,144
In the next exercise you can explore
在下一个练习中 你会看到

67
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,163
a simple mass spring system.
一个简化的重力弹簧系统

68
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,817
You'll be able to adjust the following parameters,
你将可以调节各种参数

69
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,823
mass of the particle, spring stiffness, k,
粒子质量 弹力系数k

70
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,634
and the force of gravity,
还有重力

71
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,715
and we'll ask you some challenge questions
我们会向你做一些提问

72
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:02,000
to make sure you understand the basics of Hooke's Law. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
