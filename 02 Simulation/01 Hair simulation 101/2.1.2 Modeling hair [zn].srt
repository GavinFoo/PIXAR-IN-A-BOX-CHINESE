2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:05,803
- We actually do a lot of simulation at Pixar.
我们其实为皮克斯做很多模拟上的工作

3
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,416
Things like fire, water, and explosions
比如火啊 水啊 爆炸啊

4
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:09,373
are handled by the effects department.
这些都是有特效部门完成的

5
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:13,731
You can learn more about that in the effects lesson.
你会在特效那块课程里了解更多

6
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:17,477
The simulation department, who I work with,
我工作的模拟部门

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:20,732
handles any motion attached to the characters at Pixar,
是负责所有附着于角色的物体的运动

8
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,320
like clothing and hair.
比如布料和毛发

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,660
But we can't move every hair
但我们不可能手动地

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,836
on a Pixar character's head by hand,
移动角色头上的每一根头发

11
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:28,036
that would drive our animators crazy.
那样我们的动画师就疯了

12
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:30,360
Instead, we use Physics and Computer Programming.
取而代之的，我们借助计算机和程序来实现

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,932
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
在这课中 你将学到我们
14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,349
simulate hair the same way we did for Merida
是如何模拟merida的头发的

15
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,058
in the movie "Brave".
在电影brave中

16
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,429
Here is an example of a shot of Merida
有这样一个merida的镜头

17
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,168
that the simulation department got
当时就从动画部门那儿

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,498
from the animation department
交到了我们手上

19
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,397
on the film "Brave".
负责这个片子的部门

20
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,658
The animators have created the main action in the scene
动画师已经完成了角色的动作

21
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,008
and now it's our job to fill in the missing details
现在我们要来添加失去的细节

22
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,486
such as the motion of cloth and hair.
这就是衣服和头发

23
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,673
Everything we do begins with modeling the problem
要做一件事 就要先找到

24
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,131
we want to solve.
什么问题是我们要解决的

25
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,018
In this case, we need a physical model
这里我们需要一个

26
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:57,748
of Merida's curly hair.
merida头发的物理模型

27
00:00:57,748 --> 00:01:00,088
So let's begin with the very basics.
让我们从基础开始

28
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:02,498
What should our model of hair look like?
我们的头发模型应该是怎样的

29
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:05,165
Well, hair is kind of like a mop,
你看 头发其实就像一个拖把

30
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,203
just a bunch of strings.
就是一捆线

31
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:09,794
But strings are actually quite complex
但这玩儿也是很难用数学模型来模拟的

32
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,671
to model mathematically because they are so bendy.
因为它们是这么有韧性

33
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,895
Modeling them requires a lot of computational power
对他进行数学建模需要需要很多运算能力

34
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,082
due to all the calculations involved.
正因为这么多的计算会介入

35
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:18,947
This is why we are always looking for ways
所以我们才要找一个方法

36
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,499
to simplify our models.
来优化我们建立的模型

37
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,937
For example, we could take a bunch of paper clips
比如我们可以简化成用一束纸片

38
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:24,736
to model a strand of hair.
来作为头发的模型

39
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,950
We first draw a series of line segments
我们首先画出一系列线段

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,060
connected to particles, like this.
然后像这样连接到粒子

41
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,070
The computer needs to calculate the positions
计算机需要运算

42
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,617
of these particles.
这些粒子的位置

43
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:34,545
But first we need to describe what forces
但首先我们要定义在它们上面

44
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:36,262
are acting on them.
有哪些力在作用

45
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,489
In the real world, each particle is affected
在真实世界里 所有粒子

46
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,206
by three forces.
都由三个力作用

47
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:41,456
The force of gravity,
重力

48
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:45,084
and the forces from neighboring connections, like this.
万有引力 和牵引力

49
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:47,072
Next step, I have an interactive program
下一步 我有一个交互程序

50
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,153
for you to see this in action.
来让你看看这个作用

51
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:51,173
You can adjust the following parameters:
你可以调节以下这些数据


52
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:54,292
size of each segment, number of segments per hair,
调整每个线段的长度 设置每个头发（被分割成的）线段的数量

53
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:57,943
number of hairs, and the force of gravity.
头发的数量和重力

54
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:59,670
Explore these parameters to see what kinds
不断实验不同的参数来看看

55
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,242
of looks you can come up with.
哪种是你想要的效果

56
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,000
Have fun. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
祝你愉快
