PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox


2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,535
- So far we've been exploring
what a software engineer

3
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:07,945
does at Pixar, which is
creating the tools used

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:11,068
in the filmmaking process,
such as a hair simulator

5
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,661
and all the parameters
artists can't control.

6
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:16,193
The person actually using
these tools in each film

7
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:19,445
is known at Pixar as
the Technical Director.

8
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:21,271
To better understand this kind of work,

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,580
we've invited Jacob Brooks,
a technical director

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,133
who has used hair simulation in our films.

11
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,604
Hey Jacob.

12
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:28,776
- Hey, how are you?

13
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:32,521
- Pretty good, so you worked
on Spot for The Good Dinosaur,

14
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,866
- I did, I did, yeah.

15
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,501
- So were the artisticals for Spot's hair?

16
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,375
- Well Spot was one of those
characters that you knew

17
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,729
we wanted to fall in love with right away.

18
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,214
So he had a lot of appeal in him,

19
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:47,310
but he also kind of
straddles that world of being

20
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,320
in the wilderness so he's gotta
wild and a little unkempt.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,922
So with his hair we were
able to kind of bridge

22
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,678
those two worlds so that you
can still get that feeling

23
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:01,853
of kind of a matted tangled,
kind of wild animal feel

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,166
to him but also get that appeal of like,

25
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,659
just a child that wakes up in the morning

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,560
and has adorable bed head.

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,264
So it's just super familiar to us.

28
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:13,941
So for the hair, as far
as the texture goes,

29
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,622
we knew we were gonna have to have strands

30
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,614
that were intertwining
and felt like they hadn't

31
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,795
been washed in a while, not
going towards that gross

32
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:22,747
factor but something that definitely feels

33
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:26,206
entangled and unkempt,
but also just kind of hit

34
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,656
those shapes that we knew
that we'd want to just

35
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,770
frame his face nicely and be appealing,

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,506
so that he does have that
genuine appeal in the film.

37
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,161
- So how did you model the
hair to meet these artisticals?

38
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:43,235
- Well before we can
actually simulate the hair

39
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:46,055
on a character that's moving,
like Spot as he's running

40
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:48,949
around in the film, we actually
have to groom the hair,

41
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:51,480
we have to model that shape, and for Spot,

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,220
it was an interesting
challenge because his hair

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,191
is so tangled it becomes
a very important thing

44
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:59,429
to make sure those hairs aren't
intersecting in weird ways

45
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,049
and that you can feel that
the hairs are actually

46
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,187
twisting around one another,
in order to do that,

47
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,971
we ended up using a
technique that was developed

48
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:11,913
at Disney Animation where
we're using geometric tubes

49
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:15,169
to shape gross shapes in his hair,

50
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,215
so that you can really get the appeal

51
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:21,388
of individual clumps of hair,
and see how it tapers along

52
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,816
towards the end of the
hair, so with those tubes,

53
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,224
once they're shaped in a certain way,

54
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,562
we fill those tubes with
curves, and those are the curves

55
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:32,184
that we end up simulating
as we go forward.

56
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,767
- Now that you had the
shape that you wanted,

57
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,043
how did you set up the
hair simulation to get

58
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:37,271
the look that you wanted?

59
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,312
- The sim of the hair for him is obviously

60
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:42,173
a little bit different as
well because you've got this

61
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:46,480
mangled mass of hair, it
needs to hold that shape,

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,252
and it doesn't move like
even your hair would

63
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,893
or someone with straighter
hair, so it doesn't hang

64
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:55,069
with gravity like you would
think, as a whole for Spot,

65
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,122
his hair is a little tighter
than most of our hair,

66
00:02:58,122 --> 00:03:00,364
the springs are a little bit
tighter so that you don't

67
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,831
get quite as much sag
and it really does feel

68
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,069
like it's been teased and
frazzled and kind of holds up

69
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,117
and defies gravity a little
bit more than natural

70
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,705
like longer hair would be.

71
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,000
- [Interviewer] So Spot
had variation for his hair.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,062
Like when he was wet, so how
were you able to do that?

73
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,580
- Because he was in the
wilderness and we knew

74
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,008
there was a bunch of weather
changes where sometimes

75
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,259
it's starting to rain,
sometimes it's in the middle

76
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,190
of the rain where it's getting heavier,

77
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,376
and sometimes he's soaking wet
'cause he gets in the river,

78
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:32,620
my colleague David Liley and
I worked on something to where

79
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,818
we started thinking
hey, wouldn't it be cool

80
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:37,649
if we just changed simulation
parameters to get the hair

81
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:40,374
that he started with to
be the hair as it changes.

82
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:44,280
And so he started on the
soaked version of the groom,

83
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,645
and by changing things like
the stiffness of the springs

84
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:51,788
we could lose that groomed
shape that was all spirally,

85
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:54,117
it would make it kind of flattened out,

86
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,008
we would turn up the
gravity so that it hanged

87
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,489
a little bit tighter to his face.

88
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,776
So what that allowed us to
do was change the simulation

89
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,387
parameters a little bit at a time,

90
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,610
so maybe gravity would
get a little bit stronger

91
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,900
or the springs would
get a little bit looser,

92
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,027
so that you can get a
variation of that transition

93
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:14,699
from dry to wet, but you had
various stages in the middle

94
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,574
that you could get which
normally if we were just doing

95
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,220
independent grooms, we
would have more of this kind

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,072
of on and off switch, of
like, it's dry, it's wet,

97
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,151
now we can get a nice
blend through that range.

98
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:29,548
- That's pretty cool,
thanks Jacob for coming by.

99
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:31,000
And now onto lesson two. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
