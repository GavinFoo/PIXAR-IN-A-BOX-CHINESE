00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:02,883
(bouncy Pixar theme)

3
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:05,428
- In the last exercise you probably noticed

4
00:00:05,428 --> 00:00:08,780
that the simulation lacked the natural bounciness of hair.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,678
But what makes something look bouncy anyway?

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,978
To make this model bouncy, we need each strand of hair

7
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,804
to expand and contract slightly

8
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,611
when forces are applied to them.

9
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:21,860
This required a new physical analogy to base our model on,

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,500
so we tried springs.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,877
Springs are great because they can change length

12
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,259
when you pull on them,

13
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,986
and to give the hair a little bit of weight,

14
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,999
we add a small weight to the end of the spring.

15
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,460
This is known as a mass spring system.

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,781
We can actually draw a mathematical model

17
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:41,161
to explain what happens when a spring expands and contracts.

18
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,647
The model we use is based on a law developed by Robert Hooke

19
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,961
a 17th century physicist.

20
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,343
Hooke noticed that there are two things to consider

21
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:51,903
when a spring expands and contracts.

22
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,173
One, if we pull on a spring and it expands,

23
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:58,875
we will increase its length and it will pull back together.

24
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,541
Two, if the spring contracts, its length will decrease

25
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,292
and it will push apart.

26
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:06,125
How much a spring pushes and pulls

27
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,877
is known as the spring force.

28
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:11,085
Robert Hooke was looking for relationship

29
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,503
between the spring force

30
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:15,520
in the amount the spring contracts or expands.

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,735
We call this change in length displacement.

32
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,429
Displacement is defined as the current length

33
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,749
minus the rest length of the spring.

34
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:27,520
When we stretch a spring, the displacement is positive

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,046
and the resulting spring force is negative.

36
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,775
This is known as the pull force.

37
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:36,027
When we compress a spring, the displacement is negative

38
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,382
and the resulting spring force is positive.

39
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,392
This is called the push force.

40
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,292
So Hooke's observation was quite simple,

41
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,530
he noticed that a larger displacement

42
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,730
results in a larger force,

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,681
while a smaller displacement results in a smaller force.

44
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,881
That is, he noticed that the displacement

45
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,346
is proportional to the force.

46
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,486
However, every spring is different,

47
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:01,066
some take a lot of force to displace,

48
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,616
and some are really easy to displace.

49
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:07,084
So Robert Hooke introduced the idea of stiffness

50
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:10,398
to account for how hard it is to displace a given spring.

51
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,698
It is represented with the letter k.

52
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,782
This led Hooke to his final equation

53
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,575
which is known as Hooke's Law.

54
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,374
The spring force is proportional

55
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:20,972
to a stiffness times the displacement.

56
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,107
Notice that there is a negative sign there,

57
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:25,343
that's because we want a positive force

58
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:27,169
when the displacement is negative,

59
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,781
and a negative force when it's positive.

60
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,847
If we plug this equation into the computer

61
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,215
we get this realistic spring behavior.

62
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,935
For Brave, we modeled the horse's hair

63
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:38,507
using a mass spring system

64
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,318
similar to what we are describing in this tutorial,

65
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:44,541
nearly 10,000 simulated hairs in total.

66
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,144
In the next exercise you can explore

67
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,163
a simple mass spring system.

68
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,817
You'll be able to adjust the following parameters,

69
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,823
mass of the particle, spring stiffness, k,

70
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,634
and the force of gravity,

71
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,715
and we'll ask you some challenge questions

72
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:02,000
to make sure you understand the basics of Hooke's Law. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
