00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:03,292
(metal clattering)

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:04,618
- Now that you are comfortable

4
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:06,492
with how springs expand and contract,

5
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:08,715
we can try something a
little bit different.

6
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,368
Let's try connecting a bunch
of springs together like this.

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,585
When we simulate springs,

8
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,977
we don't draw them using
the zigzag pattern.

9
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:17,346
Instead we use lines,

10
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:19,641
which can expand and contract.

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,174
This gives us a really
bouncy strand of hair,

12
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:25,369
but it's a bit too bouncy.

13
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:28,495
Notice the hairs take a really
long time to settle down.

14
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,138
This isn't very realistic.

15
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,567
Take a look at our reference shots again.

16
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,767
See how quickly the hairs come to rest,

17
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,126
just a few bounces.

18
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:39,051
You might think changing the
spring stiffness will fix this,

19
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:40,680
but look what happens.

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,501
Both low and high stiffness values

21
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,340
still result in hair
which never settles down.

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,849
Our solution to this is adding

23
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:49,733
what's called a damper to each spring.

24
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,515
A damper is something that resists

25
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,419
fast changes in displacement,

26
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,774
and it's used to bring springs

27
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,666
to rest much more quickly.

28
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,605
Check this out.

29
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,870
Here we have the same
strand of hair as before,

30
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,223
except each spring is
connected to a damper,

31
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:04,375
and we can change the amount of dampening

32
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,117
using this new parameter.

33
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,638
If we increase damping,

34
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,712
the springs resist quick changes,

35
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,846
and therefore come to rest much faster.

36
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,861
However, too much damping will result

37
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,138
in really stiff hair,

38
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,974
which isn't natural,

39
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:18,245
and here's what it looks like

40
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,968
with a whole bunch of hair.

41
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,691
We went through a similar exercise

42
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,607
in the early stages of
modeling Merida's hair.

43
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,515
We were trying to get the right mixture

44
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,273
of spring stiffnesses and damping

45
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:31,430
so that we could achieve
the desired artistic look,

46
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,101
but with the wrong settings,

47
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,315
the springs start fighting each other,

48
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,293
and you get pretty funny results.

49
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,099
So the trick is to find a nice balance

50
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,310
between spring stiffness and damping.

51
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,073
You can try this out in the next exercise.

52
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,913
Here you can control
damping of each spring,

53
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,045
number of hairs,

54
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,926
number of springs per hair,

55
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,967
and spring stiffness.

56
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,432
See if you can come up with something

57
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:56,000
that behaves a bit more realistically. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
