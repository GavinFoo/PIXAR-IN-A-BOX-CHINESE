PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox


2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,535
- So far we've been exploring what a software engineer
那刚刚呢 我们了解了下皮克斯的码农都是干啥的

3
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:07,945
does at Pixar, which is creating the tools used
主要就是为电影制作些工具啊

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:11,068
in the filmmaking process, such as a hair simulator
比如头发模拟器

5
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,661
and all the parameters artists can't control.
还有所有供艺术家使用的参数

6
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:16,193
The person actually using these tools in each film
而最终用这些工具的人

7
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:19,445
is known at Pixar as the Technical Director.
就是传说中的TD

8
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:21,271
To better understand this kind of work,
为了更好地了解这个工种

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,580
we've invited Jacob Brooks, a technical director
我们请来了Jacob Brooks

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,133
who has used hair simulation in our films.
他就是使用模拟器的人

11
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,604
Hey Jacob.
你好Jacob

12
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:28,776
- Hey, how are you?
你好 别来无恙啊

13
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:32,521
- Pretty good, so you worked on Spot for The Good Dinosaur,
挺好的 你曾参做过the good dinosaur里的spot

14
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,866
- I did, I did, yeah.
是的

15
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,501
- So were the artisticals for Spot's hair?
同样同样也有spot的毛发

16
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,375
- Well Spot was one of those characters that you knew
是的 spot是那种

17
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,729
we wanted to fall in love with right away.
我们想你一看到他就不行不行的角色

18
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,214
So he had a lot of appeal in him,
所以他有很多特性

19
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:47,310
but he also kind of straddles that world of being
但他也是那种穿越了整个狂野的世界的角色

20
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,320
in the wilderness so he's gotta wild and a little unkempt.
所以会有些野性和不羁

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,922
So with his hair we were able to kind of bridge
所以在他的毛发上 我们想能体现出这种东西

22
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,678
those two worlds so that you can still get that feeling
能让你感觉到

23
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:01,853
of kind of a matted tangled, kind of wild animal feel
那种毛糙的野性的动物特质

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,166
to him but also get that appeal of like,
但同时又能体会到

25
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,659
just a child that wakes up in the morning
初生婴儿般的

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,560
and has adorable bed head.
美好与可爱

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,264
So it's just super familiar to us.
让我们觉得有熟悉感

28
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:13,941
So for the hair, as far as the texture goes,
所以毛发设计上 从材质来看

29
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,622
we knew we were gonna have to have strands
我们知道我们要有线

30
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,614
that were intertwining and felt like they hadn't
要看上去凌乱 

31
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,795
been washed in a while, not going towards that gross
没洗过 没梳理过

32
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:22,747
factor but something that definitely feels
不是完全的乱七八糟

33
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:26,206
entangled and unkempt, but also just kind of hit
但必须不羁里又带着温存

34
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,656
those shapes that we knew that we'd want to just
有一个清晰地轮廓

35
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,770
frame his face nicely and be appealing,
来突出他的脸型 体现他的特征

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,506
so that he does have that genuine appeal in the film.
他那种真实的特质

37
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,161
- So how did you model the hair to meet these artisticals?
那你是怎么给头发建模来实现这种艺术表达的呢

38
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:43,235
- Well before we can actually simulate the hair
在我们能进行毛发模拟前

39
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:46,055
on a character that's moving, like Spot as he's running
对于这样一个角色 他在电影里的移动跑动很特别

40
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:48,949
around in the film, we actually have to groom the hair,
我们得先梳理他的头发

41
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:51,480
we have to model that shape, and for Spot,
我们要建模出他的发型

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,220
it was an interesting challenge because his hair
对他来说是个不小的挑战

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,191
is so tangled it becomes a very important thing
他的头发很凌乱 这是很重要的

44
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:59,429
to make sure those hairs aren't intersecting in weird ways
要确保他们不会以奇怪的方式打结

45
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,049
and that you can feel that the hairs are actually
但你会感觉到头发证的互相缠绕

46
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,187
twisting around one another, in order to do that,
为了实现这一点

47
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,971
we ended up using a technique that was developed
我们使用了一项迪斯尼的技术

48
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:11,913
at Disney Animation where we're using geometric tubes
几何管

49
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:15,169
to shape gross shapes in his hair,
我们用这个技术来获得毛糙的发型

50
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,215
so that you can really get the appeal
你能获得每束头发的特征

51
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:21,388
of individual clumps of hair, and see how it tapers along
并且看到他的末端

52
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,816
towards the end of the hair, so with those tubes,
如何逐渐变细 所以借助这个技术

53
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,224
once they're shaped in a certain way,
只要他们定型了

54
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,562
we fill those tubes with curves, and those are the curves
我们就在管道里填上曲线

55
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:32,184
that we end up simulating as we go forward.
而这些曲线就是最终我们要模拟的

56
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,767
- Now that you had the shape that you wanted,
现在你有了你想要的形状

57
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,043
how did you set up the hair simulation to get
那如何来设置模拟

58
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:37,271
the look that you wanted?
来获得你想要的形状呢

59
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,312
- The sim of the hair for him is obviously
他的头发很明显有些不同

60
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:42,173
a little bit different as well because you've got this
因为你有这种

61
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:46,480
mangled mass of hair, it needs to hold that shape,
扭在一起的的部分 它需要保持它的形状

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,252
and it doesn't move like even your hair would
它也不像你的头发那样

63
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,893
or someone with straighter hair, so it doesn't hang
或有些直发的那样 它不会

64
00:02:50,893 --> 00:02:55,069
with gravity like you would think, as a whole for Spot,
因重力下垂 整体来说

65
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,122
his hair is a little tighter than most of our hair,
他的头发更紧

66
00:02:58,122 --> 00:03:00,364
the springs are a little bit tighter so that you don't
所以他的弹簧也会紧一些

67
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,831
get quite as much sag and it really does feel
这样你就不会搞得很松垮 他看上去真的

68
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,069
like it's been teased and frazzled and kind of holds up
就像被玩弄过然后乱糟糟的 挺在那儿


69
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,117
and defies gravity a little bit more than natural
较自然的长发而言

70
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,705
like longer hair would be.
它对重力的抵抗更强

71
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,000
- [Interviewer] So Spot had variation for his hair.
但是这个角色也有另一种发型吧

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,062
Like when he was wet, so how were you able to do that?
比如打湿后 你们怎么做

73
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,580
- Because he was in the wilderness and we knew
因为他是野生的 所以我们知道

74
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,008
there was a bunch of weather changes where sometimes
总会有一些天气变化

75
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,259
it's starting to rain, sometimes it's in the middle
比如有刚开始下雨 有时候被浇了一会儿了

76
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,190
of the rain where it's getting heavier,
有时候是暴雨

77
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,376
and sometimes he's soaking wet
'cause he gets in the river,
有时候就是完全打湿 可能他掉进河里了

78
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:32,620
my colleague David Liley and I worked on something to where
我的同事就是琢磨该如何入手的

79
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,818
we started thinking hey, wouldn't it be cool
我们就像 能不能通过调整参数来实现

80
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:37,649
if we just changed simulation parameters to get the hair
我们对头发不同状态的模拟

81
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:40,374
that he started with to be the hair as it changes.
当头发变化的时候

82
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:44,280
And so he started on the soaked version of the groom,
所以他先从完全打湿开始

83
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,645
and by changing things like the stiffness of the springs
通过改变弹簧弹力系数

84
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:51,788
we could lose that groomed shape that was all spirally,
我们能让螺旋状的发型松垮

85
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:54,117
it would make it kind of flattened out,
然后贴到别的东西上

86
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,008
we would turn up the gravity so that it hanged
然后调高重力 

87
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,489
a little bit tighter to his face.
他就紧紧贴在脸上

88
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,776
So what that allowed us to do was change the simulation
所以我们可以通过改变模拟参数

89
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,387
parameters a little bit at a time,
来调整我们需要的效果

90
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,610
so maybe gravity would get a little bit stronger
重力再强些

91
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,900
or the springs would get a little bit looser,
弹力松些

92
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,027
so that you can get a variation of that transition
你就能得到从干到湿之间的一个数值分布

93
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:14,699
from dry to wet, but you had various stages in the middle
这就能形成各种各样的中间效果

94
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,574
that you could get which normally if we were just doing
这样你就能获得每一个头发的效果

95
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,220
independent grooms, we would have more of this kind
然后我们设计了各种开关

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,072
of on and off switch, of like, it's dry, it's wet,
干 湿 干 湿 就像这样

97
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,151
now we can get a nice blend through that range.
现在我们就有了混合效果

98
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:29,548
- That's pretty cool, thanks Jacob for coming by.
这很酷 谢谢

99
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:31,000
And now onto lesson two.
