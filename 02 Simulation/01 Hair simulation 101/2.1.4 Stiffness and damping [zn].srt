00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:03,292
(metal clattering)

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:04,618
- Now that you are comfortable
现在我们对弹簧的作用方式

4
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:06,492
with how springs expand and contract,
有了一定的了解

5
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:08,715
we can try something a little bit different.
我们可以做一些不一样的东西了

6
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,368
Let's try connecting a bunch of springs together like this.
现在我们试着把一束弹簧像这样连接起来

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,585
When we simulate springs,
当我们模拟弹簧的时候

8
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,977
we don't draw them using the zigzag pattern.
我们不是用锯齿模式的

9
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:17,346
Instead we use lines,
而是用

10
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:19,641
which can expand and contract.
可以伸缩的线

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,174
This gives us a really bouncy strand of hair,
这能给我们很有弹性的头发

12
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:25,369
but it's a bit too bouncy.
但是这也看上去太弹性了

13
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:28,495
Notice the hairs take a really long time to settle down.
我们发现头发要过很久才稳定下来

14
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,138
This isn't very realistic.
这就不真实

15
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,567
Take a look at our reference shots again.
看下我们的参考视频

16
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,767
See how quickly the hairs come to rest,
我们看到头发稳定的很快

17
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,126
just a few bounces.
只是弹了几下

18
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:39,051
You might think changing the spring stiffness will fix this,
你可能觉得修改弹性系数能解决这个问题

19
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:40,680
but look what happens.
但看看结果呢

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,501
Both low and high stiffness values
无论设高还是设低

21
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,340
still result in hair which never settles down.
结构都是这样

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,849
Our solution to this is adding
我们的解决方法其实是

23
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:49,733
what's called a damper to each spring.
给每个弹簧添加一个减震器

24
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,515
A damper is something that resists
减震器能保证弹簧

25
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,419
fast changes in displacement,
快速的变形

26
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,774
and it's used to bring springs
但又能使弹簧

27
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,666
to rest much more quickly.
更快速地稳定下来

28
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,605
Check this out.
看看这个

29
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,870
Here we have the same strand of hair as before,
这是之前的

30
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,223
except each spring is connected to a damper,
每个弹簧都连接到一个减震器

31
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:04,375
and we can change the amount of dampening
我们还可以改变阻尼系数

32
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,117
using this new parameter.
使用这个新的系数

33
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,638
If we increase damping,
如果我们增加他

34
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,712
the springs resist quick changes,
弹簧变化的快

35
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,846
and therefore come to rest much faster.
稳定的也快

36
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,861
However, too much damping will result
但是太大的话 

37
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,138
in really stiff hair,
就会令头发变得很硬

38
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,974
which isn't natural,
那看上去就不自然

39
00:01:16,974 --> 00:01:18,245
and here's what it looks like
这里就是这整把头发

40
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,968
with a whole bunch of hair.
看上去的样子

41
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,691
We went through a similar exercise
我们经历过同样的探索

42
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,607
in the early stages of modeling Merida's hair.
在早期为merida的头发建立数学模型的时候

43
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:26,515
We were trying to get the right mixture
我们想要有得到弹性系数和阻尼

44
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,273
of spring stiffnesses and damping
真实的作用效果

45
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:31,430
so that we could achieve the desired artistic look,
这样我们才能达到艺术上的真实感受

46
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,101
but with the wrong settings,
但是因为设置错误

47
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,315
the springs start fighting each other,
头发之间就开始碰撞

48
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,293
and you get pretty funny results.
你就得到了很搞笑的结果

49
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:39,099
So the trick is to find a nice balance
所以诀窍就在于要找到一个平衡

50
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,310
between spring stiffness and damping.
在弹力系数和阻尼之间的平衡

51
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,073
You can try this out in the next exercise.
在下一个练习中 你可以试试这个

52
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,913
Here you can control damping of each spring,
这里你能空持每个弹簧的阻尼

53
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,045
number of hairs,
头发数量

54
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,926
number of springs per hair,
每个头发的弹簧数量

55
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,967
and spring stiffness.
以及弹力系数

56
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,432
See if you can come up with something
看看你能不能做出什么

57
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:56,000
that behaves a bit more realistically. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
看上去更真实的东西来
