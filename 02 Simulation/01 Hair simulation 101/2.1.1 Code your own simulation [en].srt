00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:02,027
Hi, I'm Hayley Iben

3
00:00:02,027 --> 00:00:03,993
I'm a software engineer at Pixar.

4
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:05,527
I worked on the hair simulator

5
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:07,516
for the movie, Brave.

6
00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:09,752
Hair was a really big deal in Brave.

7
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:11,518
It was a symbol of
freedom that was intrinsic

8
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,514
to our main character
Merida's personality.

9
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,297
And making hair that feels right,

10
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:18,246
meaning messy, wild and free,

11
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:21,013
is a hard thing to do computationally.

12
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:23,501
In our movies, hair is a simulated effect.

13
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,248
That means no one animates
its movement by hand.

14
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,030
The way it moves is defined by physics

15
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,314
and programmed into the computer.

16
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:32,535
To figure out what hair
simulation should look like,

17
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:34,240
we needed to look at real curly hair

18
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,741
and see how it worked.

19
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:37,033
What we found was this.

20
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:39,006
Curly hair forms together in locks

21
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,232
that reshape themselves
when you pull on them,

22
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:42,757
kind of like a spring.

23
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:44,501
This was great news because springs

24
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,005
can be modeled mathematically,

25
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,508
meaning we can simulate their behavior

26
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:49,949
using a computer program.

27
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,293
From the computer's perspective,

28
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,524
Merida's hair is just
lots and lots of springs

29
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:55,765
that react to forces, such as gravity,

30
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,468
as Merida moves.

31
00:00:57,468 --> 00:01:00,023
The tests we ran using this
approach were pretty good,

32
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:01,798
but not quite natural enough.

33
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:04,483
While stiffer springs held
the shape of the curl,

34
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,553
it didn't bounce like natural curls.

35
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:08,130
When we made the springs loser,

36
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,498
her curls would unwind when she moved.

37
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:12,245
This was even more obvious at high,

38
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:15,245
often unrealistic speeds,
found in animation.

39
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:16,785
We realized we needed something

40
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,747
to preserve the structure of the curl,

41
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:21,508
but not impede the overall
motion of the hair,

42
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:22,988
kinda like digital hairspray.

43
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,253
(can hissing)
Oh, sorry (laughs).

44
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,241
We came up with the idea of connecting

45
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,763
the springs that make up
Merida's on-screen hair

46
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:32,985
to invisible core springs like this.

47
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:34,522
The core springs would limit the movement

48
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:35,555
of the on-screen hair

49
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,504
when the motion was more extreme.

50
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:39,787
This way, we could have
the best of both worlds.

51
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:41,754
Our original simulation we create motion

52
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,480
that was soft and natural,

53
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,105
but the core springs would keep the curl

54
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,001
from unwinding too much.

55
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,483
Figuring out how to make
a hair simulation system

56
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,238
that could help us achieve
the feeling we wanted

57
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,768
for Merida's hair was hard.

58
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:57,039
It took a lot of
iterations to get it right,

59
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,302
but it made a big difference.

60
00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:01,067
Merida feels like a real girl,

61
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:02,000
messy, wild and free. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
