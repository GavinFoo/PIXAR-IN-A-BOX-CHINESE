2
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,297
(jumping, bouncing)

3
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:03,265
(light switches on)

4
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:04,098
- Great work.
干得好

5
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:05,682
So far we've built up a model of hair
现在我们建了一个头发模型

6
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:08,013
using a series of damped springs.
通过使用一系列的阻尼弹簧

7
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:10,353
This gives us a more realistic behavior,
这给我们更真实的效果

8
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:12,804
like this style I came up with.
就像这样

9
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,270
But remember, the art department
但记住 艺术部门想要merida的头发

10
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,901
wants Merida's hair to be curly.
是卷曲的

11
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,640
Sometimes it curls up while moving but it doesn't
有时候他在运动时是卷的

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,384
hold that curly shape while at rest.
但在静止时就不卷了

13
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:25,729
Here's an idea.
这里有一个方法

14
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,812
What if we put some smaller springs in between
我们何不放一些小弹簧

15
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:30,378
the larger springs to pull them together?
到大弹簧之间 把他们拉在一起

16
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,266
Let's call them support springs.
我们就叫它们支撑弹簧

17
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,722
We already have a mathematical model of the spring
我们已经有了一个弹簧的数学模型

18
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:36,645
so this is easy to test out.
所以这个实验起来很简单

19
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,818
If I connect a support spring between the larger
如果我在大弹簧之间连小弹簧

20
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:41,920
springs, I get something like this.
他看起来就像这样

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,414
If I hide the support springs, you'll notice the hair
如果我设小弹簧不可见

22
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:47,034
comes to a rest in a curly shape.
你就会看到头发在静止时也是卷曲的

23
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,426
That's much better.
这好多了

24
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,104
Adding these support springs results
加上这些小弹簧

25
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:52,675
in new parameters we can control.
意味着我们能添加更多的控制器

26
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,787
The stiffness and length of the support springs.
就是支撑弹簧的弹性系数和长度

27
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:59,182
Shorter support springs will give us smaller curls,
小的产生小卷儿

28
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:02,453
while really long support springs give us bigger ones.
大的能有大波浪

29
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:05,267
And if we make the support springs have a higher stiffness
如果更硬

30
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,474
the curl pops up like this.
卷曲就像这样弹

31
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:09,805
Kind of like we applied hairspray.
就像我们用了发胶一样

32
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:12,913
Compare this to support springs with lower stiffness.
弹性系数小一些

33
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:14,839
In this case, the curls relax a bit
卷儿就比较蓬松

34
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,785
and fall downwards in a natural way.
自然下垂

35
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:20,203
Now, let's try this with a bunch of hairs.
然后我们来试试一堆头发的情况

36
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,577
Now that's starting to look more like Merida.
现在更像merida了

37
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,911
This isn't exactly the method we used on Merida
这虽然不是我们真正用在merida身上的方法

38
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:27,040
for the movie, but it's close.
但很接近了

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,187
In this next interactive you can try this out
在下一个交互里 你可以试试这个

40
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,896
with all the parameters we've introduced.
用我们介绍过的这些参数

41
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:35,629
The two new parameters are support spring stiffness
这两个新的就是支撑弹簧的弹性系数

42
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,801
and support spring length.
和长度

43
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,000
See what you can come up with.
