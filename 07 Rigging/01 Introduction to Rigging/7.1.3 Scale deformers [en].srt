00:00:03,376 --> 00:00:06,099
- When John Lasseter created this animated short,

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,199
he wanted a younger lamp.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,116
He observed that children tend to

5
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:12,176
have bigger heads and bottoms,

6
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:15,365
as compared to the rest of their bodies.

7
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,183
So to make this lamp appear younger,

8
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,307
he scaled down the lamp, and then he scaled

9
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:22,645
up the foot and head to make Jr.

10
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:25,175
To get a little experience in creating a new model,

11
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,729
let's add some scaling deformers to modify the lamp.

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,397
At Pixar, the art department often

13
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,601
gives us draw overs to guide us in

14
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,521
remodeling the character.

15
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,093
In the following exercise, we see a draw over,

16
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:40,434
like this one, that you will try to match,

17
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:43,148
using scaling deformers.

18
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:47,000
When you're done, your lamp should look much younger. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
