00:00:00,822 --> 00:00:01,861
(clicking noises)

3
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:03,922
(ding)

4
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:04,999
- Great work.

5
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:07,221
You probably discovered that changing the base scale

6
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:10,905
changes the arm scale and the head scale.

7
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:14,603
This is because the scales affect each other.

8
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:16,621
When you're working with controls like a scale deformer

9
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,180
that affects a whole model or a bunch of parts,

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,780
it's best to get the overall scale right

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,184
before the individual parts.

12
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,079
We call this working from rough to fine.

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,443
We now have all the concepts we need to model

14
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:30,840
and rig our lamp.

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,193
Go ahead and add scales to your lamp

16
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:36,101
to make it appear younger or older.

17
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:39,683
Add rotates to all the joints so you can pose the lamp.

18
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:42,079
Add translates and a rotate to the base

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,375
so you can move the lamp around.

20
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,260
And after the exercise, we have a bonus tip

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,363
which we will allow you

22
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,760
to try animating your fully rigged lamp.

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,884
You should definitely check out the animation lesson

24
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,602
before trying that one.

25
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:55,600
