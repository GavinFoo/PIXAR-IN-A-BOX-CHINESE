PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
yeah, so, early, early on - I grew up

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
my dad didn't believe in having a TV in the house

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because he didn't want me to waste my time

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
watching Saturday-morning cartoons

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I love cartoons!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The penmanship and craftsmanship was incredible

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that was the inspiration

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and it also became entertainment for me

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I just love to just, you know

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
spend my time drawing.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
&gt; Do you have any examples that we can-

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have any pictures or anything

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
of that early artwork?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
&gt; I could! Yeah, I have artwork at home

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that I can dig up and that's

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you know, I'll be embarrassed to show.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'll show it regardless,

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'cause you're all my friends out there.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, art is one of those things

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you all start from a place of being-

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
feeling sensitive about it,

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but you just keep doing it, and you enjoy it

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and you get better at it

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of those things that fulfills itself.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh! I- I built my own computer

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
when I was about 12 or 13.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Australia was going to dominate

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
the computer industry with a computer

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
called the Microbee, so I went ahead and

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
made this Microbee, and then

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I could program,

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could actually create characters from it

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So one of the big gaming systems back then

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
was called Aliens, so one of the first programs

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I created was these aliens

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
going across the screen

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and you could shoot 'em, and we used a thing

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
called aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
