PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:04,421
- Welcome to Pixar.

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,821
In the next lesson you'll learn
to rig your own character.

4
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,403
(drum and cymbal clash)

5
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:09,827
If you've gone through
the animation lesson,

6
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:10,802
you've already learned how to

7
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:15,135
create an animated performance
of a bouncing ball.

8
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:16,471
We gave you controls which allowed you to

9
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:19,299
move the ball around,
and stretch it like this,

10
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:20,682
or squash it like that.

11
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:22,909
These transformations
are defined by different

12
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:25,071
kinds of deformers.

13
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,015
For example, a rotate deformer will

14
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:30,033
let you rotate the ball,
a translate deformer will

15
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:32,277
allow you to move the
ball in any direction,

16
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:34,186
and a scale deformer can be used to

17
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:37,209
squash the ball when it hits the ground.

18
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,121
Figuring out and creating
these deformers is

19
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:40,530
the job of a rigger.

20
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,964
It's pretty simple when done with a ball.

21
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:46,680
It gets a lot more complicated
when dealing with a car.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,765
And a human baby is really hard.

23
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:54,039
As you can see, I'm standing
next to this giant lamp,

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,048
who was featured in Luxo Jr.,

25
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:59,441
one of the first short
films made at Pixar.

26
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,256
Although lamps are just
solid objects without

27
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,247
their own movement or emotions,

28
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,775
a young animator named
John Lasseter believed

29
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,822
he could make it into an actor.

30
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,379
He saw how this lamp could become

31
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:13,003
a lifelike character if
it was given a simple rig.

32
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:14,605
This rig is made up of deformers that

33
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:18,367
can make the lamp rotate,
translate, and scale.

34
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,432
In 1986, a rigging
artist named Evan Auspie

35
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,185
had to work extremely hard to create

36
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:25,185
the software that would rig the lamp,

37
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,013
and allow John to create
his animated performance.

38
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:29,480
In the rest of this
lesson, you will get to

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,040
create the rig which will
allow us to animate our lamp.

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,052
Before we rig our lamp, we
need to examine him closely.

41
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:39,483
You'll notice that it consists of a base,

42
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,021
a mid, and a lamp head.

43
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:45,913
And this is connected
by joints that rotate.

44
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,152
And what you'll notice is that

45
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:50,200
one rotational deformer will move a joint,

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,877
which causes it to rotate, and there is

47
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:56,409
some dependence of the other
joints upon that rotation.

48
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,261
Dependence of one part on another is

49
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:01,919
what we call a hierarchy.

50
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,187
And it's our job as a rigger to

51
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,578
determine what that hierarchy is.

52
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,825
So that when one joint rotates,

53
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:10,696
all the other joints will follow.

54
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:13,139
In this first exercise,
let's rig our lamp with

55
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,531
the simple rotations we talked about.

56
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:16,937
You would do this by dragging

57
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,682
the rotate deformers
onto each of the joints.

58
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,675
With just four rotates, it is possible to

59
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,598
create poses that express a wide range of

60
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,592
emotions and actions.

61
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,443
Typically a rigger will test a rig by

62
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,198
creating a number of poses that

63
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:32,645
will show off what the rig can do.

64
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,837
(laughter)

65
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:37,000
These people are also riggers. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
