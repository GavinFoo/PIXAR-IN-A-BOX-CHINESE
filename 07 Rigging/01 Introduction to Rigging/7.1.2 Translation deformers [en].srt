PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:06,592
- The area I'm posing in is our drawing classroom.

3
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:11,427
We call it big art because it's a really big space.

4
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:13,453
This is where artists practice drawing models

5
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:15,206
and different poses.

6
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:16,831
The artists want to draw not only the shape

7
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:20,266
of the character, but the emotions they're expressing.

8
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:22,281
Typically the pose is only held for a minute,

9
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,349
so you have to draw quickly and loosely.

10
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,082
We call this style of drawing gestural drawing

11
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,553
and it's a great way to capture the idea

12
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:31,755
behind the drawing without worrying about

13
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,699
capturing all the little details within the drawing.

14
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,141
Speaking of posing, I hope you enjoyed how expressive

15
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:39,581
your lamp could be with just a few controls.

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,943
Now we're gonna add action to the emotion

17
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:43,592
and make your lamp jump.

18
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:45,160
Think about what you do when you jump

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,462
from standing still.

20
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:49,422
First you bend and squash down,

21
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,877
then you jump stretching out.

22
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:55,368
These are two different poses we're gonna need for our lamp,

23
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,102
squash and stretch.

24
00:00:58,102 --> 00:00:59,871
So we need to add controls to the lamp

25
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:01,671
so it can move to a new location.

26
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,685
We can do this by adding rotation and translation deformers

27
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,179
to the base of the lamp.

28
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:08,634
One thing we need to be aware of when add deformers

29
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:12,012
is that some deformers need to operate in a certain order.

30
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:14,938
This might be a little hard to picture, so let me show you.

31
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,040
If we Rotate before we Translate, we get a different effect

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,883
than if Translate and then Rotate.

33
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:25,256
Notice that we can arrange the order of these deformers

34
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:27,709
by clicking and dragging like this.

35
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,873
The order in which they operate flows in this direction.

36
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,494
The animators who use this are moving to a position

37
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,608
and then posing with Rotates, moving to another position,

38
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:39,497
and posing a Rotate again, and so on.

39
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:41,518
So they should be able to Rotate about the base

40
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,483
no matter where they Translate it.

41
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:47,299
But if our deformers operate in the wrong order,

42
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,330
Translate then Rotate, we will run into a problem.

43
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,884
The rotation of the lamp will move away

44
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,955
from the pose like this.

45
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:56,819
That's because we moved the lamp away

46
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,613
from the axis of rotation,

47
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:01,712
which is the initial position of the base.

48
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:04,114
We solve this problem by having our deformers operate

49
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,661
in the opposite order.

50
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:07,895
First we Rotate about the origin of the base,

51
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,131
and then we move the base.

52
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:14,956
This dependence on ordering is called non-commutativity.

53
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,562
(drum beat)

54
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:17,965
Well, you can learn more about this

55
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:21,251
in the set and staging lesson.

56
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:22,242
(laughs)

57
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,444
(xylophone notes)

58
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,175
In this next exercise our goal

59
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,375
is to move our lamp into place

60
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,428
and then pose him with rotations.

61
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:32,367
So you'll need to pay attention to the ordering

62
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:36,010
of your translation and rotational deformers.

63
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,051
Have fun!

64
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:41,000
