00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,930
- We can express so much
emotion through our bodies.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,842
But I really love using rigging to

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,669
make expressive faces.

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:13,424
It is fascinating to learn about how

6
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:16,740
faces display emotions or ideas.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,588
There's so much detail
in every expression.

8
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,858
In our next exercise, we're
gonna rig a snowman face.

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,044
And we need some new deformers to do that.

10
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:28,286
First, let's add a direction scale.

11
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:30,390
A directional scale allows us to

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,258
scale in just one direction.

13
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:35,501
If you scale the hat using Scale Y,

14
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,393
you'll get a taller hate
that looks like a top hat.

15
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:40,375
If you scale the face with Scale X,

16
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,442
you will get a wider face.

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,408
You also need shear deformers.

18
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:48,628
Shear deformers are similar
to directional scales,

19
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,876
in the sense that they work
in a specific direction.

20
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:54,769
We also have our set of rotates,

21
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,376
and translates, and scales,
that we already used.

22
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:01,070
Just as before, you
should work rough to fine,

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,861
with retaining the head to begin with.

24
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:06,280
And then, translating
and rotating the hat.

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,412
Remember, the order of
your deformers matters,

26
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:12,378
to test your controls as you work.

27
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:13,792
When you finish rigging the head,

28
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,152
move on to the next lesson where

29
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:19,000
you'll learn to write code
to make your own character. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
