00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:05,353
- What's the difference between motion and life?

3
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:07,815
What's the difference between this mechanical smile

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,522
and this friendly smile?

5
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:10,625
It's a little harder to find,

6
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,645
but there's just something

7
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,879
about the way a living being moves.

8
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:15,430
And we work incredibly hard to capture

9
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,171
with our characters here at Pixar

10
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:19,070
and that something start

11
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,123
with a stage we call rigging.

12
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:22,708
Hi, I'm Brian Green,

13
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,505
a Rigging Technical Director here at Pixar.

14
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:27,975
Rigging is a process of adding controls

15
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:29,070
to a digital model

16
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,106
to allow animators to move it around and act.

17
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,376
When you look at the way a living being moves,

18
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,903
every motion they make causes a reaction

19
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,748
in every other part of their body.

20
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,921
For instance, when I smile,

21
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,899
it's not just my lips have moved,

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,217
my cheeks bulge,

23
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:46,084
the skin around my eyes crinkle.

24
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:50,055
My chin stretches out to accommodate the emotion.

25
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:52,997
We call this defamation and displacement.

26
00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:54,379
Arrlalalala.

27
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:55,654
In rigging, we have a toolbox

28
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,701
of hundreds of different deformers

29
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,534
and we can attach to

30
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,578
the surface mesh of our characters.

31
00:01:00,578 --> 00:01:02,938
All of them represent mathematical formulas

32
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,751
that define a relationship between the many points

33
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,459
that are affected by the motion.

34
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,304
For instance, I can start rigging Sully's mouth

35
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,766
by adding a simple deformer called a rotate.

36
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:15,239
The underlying math here is trigonometry.

37
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,498
I'm going to add another tool called a repulsor.

38
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:20,099
This basically puffs things in and out.

39
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,444
Add this to the cheeks,

40
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:22,488
and link them.

41
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,465
And then when we move his jaw,

42
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:25,659
his cheeks bulges.

43
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,538
That's better,

44
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,164
but it's still just the beginning.

45
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:31,331
Sully's face alone uses over 500 deformers

46
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,834
and that's just his face.

47
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:33,983
We can take a similar approach to

48
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,755
rigging the characters' bodies too.

49
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:37,941
Adding deformers that define a relationship

50
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,828
between the knees and the calf,

51
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:41,166
the tail and the rump,

52
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,286
or this tentacle and that tentacle.

53
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,932
After we got the physiology right,

54
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:46,395
we need to remember that these characters

55
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:48,096
are film actors.

56
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,678
So the kind of motion that they may need to make

57
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,258
might be a little more extreme than a regular monster.

58
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:54,555
So we push it a little,

59
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,492
gives them extra life

60
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:59,000
so they can be extra exciting on the screen. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
