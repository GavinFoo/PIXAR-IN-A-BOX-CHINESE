00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,538
- Alright, you finally have a
snowman to start working with.

3
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:09,930
Now we can get to the real
guts of the rigging software.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,748
We need to define our scale, rotate,

5
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,097
and translate deformers.

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,889
To allow you to move your shapes around.

7
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:19,919
And this is where
functions come into play.

8
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:27,143
Remember, functions package
a series of operations

9
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:30,001
or procedures we'll use many times.

10
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,470
Functions are set input which they perform

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,504
a set of operations on.

12
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:37,339
Now, to build any deformer,
we'll need a function

13
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:39,389
which intercepts two inputs.

14
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:42,067
First they must intercept
a pair of coordinates

15
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,078
which is the vertex in our shape.

16
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,609
And lay a set of value

17
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:49,502
which is a magnitude of
transformation you want to apply.

18
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,816
For example, the translate x to full

19
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:54,957
might intercept a coordinate 2,2.

20
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:59,701
And for the 2nd input would
provide a value of say five.

21
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,802
And so this translate x function,

22
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:03,729
the math we'll do is quite simple.

23
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,901
Hey that's five to the x coordinate

24
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:09,424
which updates it to 7,2

25
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:11,097
and that's the process for transforming

26
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:12,980
each vertex into shape.

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,876
Of course, a shapes contain many vertices.

28
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,119
For example, a hat has eight.

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,581
That means its function
is run eight times.

30
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,371
Once for each vertex.

31
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,212
Order of the deformer
functions transform vertices

32
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,166
using equations.

33
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,631
And the transformation depends
on the types of equations

34
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:32,334
used in your functions.

35
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:35,563
The equations used for scaling,
rotate, and translation

36
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,565
are all different from each other.

37
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,431
We cover these equations in detail

38
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:42,352
in our sets and staging lesson.

39
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:46,541
In the next code review,

40
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,529
we'll give you an example of
writing a translation function

41
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,209
and then in the exercise,
we'll allow you to write

42
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,619
free deformer functions on your own.

43
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:55,986
Alright, I'm out of here.

44
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:58,000
