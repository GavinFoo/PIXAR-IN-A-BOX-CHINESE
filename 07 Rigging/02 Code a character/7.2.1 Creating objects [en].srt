00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,326
(ball bounce)

3
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:05,155
- In this lesson we're going to explore

4
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:08,598
the wonderful world of rigging software.

5
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:13,045
(drilling loudly)

6
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,520
To build a character at Pixar,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,412
we begin with a modeling packet.

8
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,953
A model packet consists of a series of drawings

9
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,886
or clay sculptures called maquettes

10
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:23,553
that are a guide for modeling the character.

11
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:24,789
For more important characters,

12
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,339
there can be a lot of drawings.

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,050
And for less important characters

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,015
it might just be a scribble on the napkin.

15
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:34,367
From these we build the model in the computer.

16
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,843
I hope you enjoyed rigging the face for a snowman

17
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:37,815
in lesson one.

18
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:40,247
In this lesson, you're going to create your character

19
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,726
in a similar manner to how Pixar built a snowman

20
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,866
for the short film Knick Knack.

21
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:48,590
Before starting, the rigger will meet with an animator

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,353
and discuss what type of controls are needed.

23
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:55,148
A character, like the army man from Toy Story,

24
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:56,854
would be made from plastic.

25
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:59,741
So its movements would be quite stiff.

26
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:04,067
In contrast, a rubber snake would be quite flexible.

27
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,656
Keeping true to the materials creates believability,

28
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:09,340
the rigger and the animator work closely

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,477
throughout the rigging process to make sure

30
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:14,471
the animator gets all the controls she needs to make

31
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:17,272
the character come alive and act.

32
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:19,175
The animator will do various tests

33
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:23,093
such as calisthenics to test a range of rigging.

34
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:26,604
The final test is usually a fully active scene.

35
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:29,645
In this lesson you'll write code to design your model,

36
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,830
then rig your model with the former that you learnt

37
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,887
about in the previous lesson.

38
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,283
You'll start by drawing basic shapes,

39
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:40,058
then you'll combine the shape to make characters,

40
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,938
then you'll build there the former functions

41
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:44,824
for translate, scale and rotate.

42
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:48,546
And finally, you'll connect everything together.

43
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,629
And in a bonus step,

44
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,508
we'll show you how to animate your models.

45
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:58,057
But first, let's think about what we are doing.

46
00:01:58,057 --> 00:02:00,407
All models have one thing in common,

47
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,043
from the perspective of the computer,

48
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,893
a model is just a collection of individual shapes.

49
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:09,054
Each shape will be stored in the computer as an object.

50
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:14,845
To create the shape of a circle,

51
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:17,057
we'll put in the object all the data the computer

52
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:19,789
will need to create that shape.

53
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,305
In this warm up exercise, you'll create a circle

54
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:24,140
for the snowman's body.

55
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,661
If you're new to coding we have a short code review

56
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,015
before the exercise.

57
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:28,000
