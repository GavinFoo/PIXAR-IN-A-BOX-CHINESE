00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:06,152
- [Narrator] Okay, so far you've
made a single shape object

3
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:09,057
which contains information
to draw a circle,

4
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:12,138
but we'll need more shapes
to build our snowman,

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,992
and we'll want to store
all of these shapes

6
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:15,276
inside one data structure,

7
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,816
which represents our snowman model.

8
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:20,170
One way we can do this is with an array,

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,891
where each position in the
array holds one shape object.

10
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,512
In the next exercise, you'll
define an array called

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,643
shapes array to do this.

12
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:37,493
Think of this shapes
array as our entire model.

13
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:39,058
It has everything the computer needs

14
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,310
to draw all the pieces of the model.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,776
But what about a hat for Nick?

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,155
We can't draw that with circles...

17
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,920
That would be crazy!

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,036
The short film, Nick Nack,

19
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:52,646
was made with simple geometric shapes.

20
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:53,979
One easy way to draw any shape

21
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,295
is to define a series of
points called vertices.

22
00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:01,383
For example, the hat would
need eight vertices like this.

23
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,216
Each of these points

24
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:05,424
is represented by a pair of coordinates.

25
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,676
And then, the entire
list of these vertices

26
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:11,908
can be stored in a larger array.

27
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:17,614
So we'll have an array of arrays
to store any shape we want.

28
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:19,236
And we'll let another part of the program

29
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:21,653
actually connect these dots for us.

30
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:24,064
First up, we have two exercises for you.

31
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,121
In the first exercise,

32
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,375
you'll be creating a shapes array

33
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,746
to hold each of your shape objects.

34
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:31,864
This will allow you to add
your head and your body.

35
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:34,524
After that, you'll have a
chance to create any shape,

36
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:37,642
starting with a classic, black hat.

37
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,599
Have fun! (laughs)

38
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,497
Yay!

39
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:42,000
Go for it! aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
