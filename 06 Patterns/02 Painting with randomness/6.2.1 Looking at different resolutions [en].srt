2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,996
- In the previous lesson, we focused

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,848
on the geometry of dinosaur skins and scales.

4
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:09,275
- (Blonde Woman) And we used voronoi diagrams

5
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,391
to get the overall structure we were looking for.

6
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:12,423
- (Brunette Woman) But we simplified a shading

7
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:16,659
of our skin using only two solid colors with no texture.

8
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:17,678
- This is why our final result

9
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:19,062
wasn't very realistic.

10
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,710
We ignored the finer details we see in actual skin.

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,932
When you look at your own skin,

12
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:23,952
do you see one color?

13
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:27,006
- No, I see a subtle variation in color and texture.

14
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:27,006
- (Blonde Woman) This variation

15
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,923
becomes really clear when we look

16
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:32,100
at things under different magnifications or resolutions.

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,446
Here's an image of human skin at a very high resolution.

18
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:36,625
- (Brunette Woman) Wow, it reveals

19
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,600
a whole new world of texture and color variation.

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,773
There's nothing smooth or solid about this.

21
00:00:42,773 --> 00:00:44,072
- (Blonde Woman) Right, and because we see

22
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:46,639
different patterns at different resolutions,

23
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,270
we say that natural surfaces have

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,467
a multiresolution structure.

25
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,217
- (Brunette Woman) Let's do another example of this.

26
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,601
- (Blonde Woman) In our shading packet,

27
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,637
we have an image of a Maximo alligator

28
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:57,589
as reference for our dino scales.

29
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,033
Here's what we see at low resolution.

30
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,332
The skin looks very bumpy and the color's interesting.

31
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:04,596
- (Brunette Woman) Notice the checkerboard pattern

32
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,042
across the scales, and within each scale

33
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,406
the color looks fairly solid.

34
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,523
- (Blonde Woman) Let's zoom in to a higher resolution.

35
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:13,348
Here we see smaller scales

36
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,996
which look quite smooth and rounded.

37
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:17,218
- (Brunette Woman) And notice there's much more

38
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,619
color variation that we didn't see before.

39
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,370
It looks like a speckling of color

40
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,073
due to natural pigmentation as well as dirt.

41
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:25,073
- (Blonde Woman) Another reference

42
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,840
for our dino skin is snake skin.

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,351
At this low resolution it looks like

44
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:32,412
a collection of solid white and black scales.

45
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:33,796
- (Brunette Woman) But at higher resolutions

46
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:36,694
we see new color details.

47
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:39,678
The white scales contain tiny brown dots

48
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:40,980
and the black scales have

49
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,337
a light coloration around the edges.

50
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,515
- (Blonde Woman) And if we keep zooming in

51
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,758
things get (laughs) really crazy.

52
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:48,033
- (Brunette Woman) Aggh! That's scary!

53
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:48,033
(laughs)

54
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:52,551
It seems like the closer you look, the more you find.

55
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,013
- Exactly, and that's the essence

56
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,886
of multiresolution structures.

57
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,434
The color and texture of an object

58
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:58,419
is the result of adding all

59
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,617
of the different details together.

60
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:01,649
- Before applying these different ideas

61
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,483
to our dino skin, let's pause

62
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:05,108
for a moment and get you comfortable

63
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:07,837
look at the world at different resolutions.

64
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,674
- In the next exercise, we'll challenge you

65
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:12,279
to identify surfaces at different resolutions.

66
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,886
And remember, things aren't always what they seem.

67
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,122
What's your favorite example of something you worked

68
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:19,113
on that had a really interesting mix of patterns?

69
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,062
- For The Good Dinosaur, on the pterodactyls,

70
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:22,687
each part of their body had a bunch

71
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,440
of different textures like the crest

72
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,473
had this brain-like texture,

73
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:29,124
it was kind of icky (laughs) and gross,

74
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,527
and then the neck we used almost like a

75
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,842
dried lava texture to give that feeling of wrinkles.

76
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:39,061
On the wings we based it on elephant skin

77
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,016
so it would be kind of softer.

78
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:45,494
And then the body was more like a dry skin feeling,

79
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,768
almost like E.T. phone home (laughs)

80
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,276
kind of feel to it.

81
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:50,172
It was pretty nice.

82
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,086
It all came back together and we used

83
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:53,507
different illumination techniques

84
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,503
to make it feel more interesting.

85
00:02:55,503 --> 00:02:57,413
But we used quite a few textures

86
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:59,977
to mix and match and kind of flow

87
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,461
from one part of the body to the other.

88
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:03,497
- Pretty cool.
- It turned out okay.

89
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,000
