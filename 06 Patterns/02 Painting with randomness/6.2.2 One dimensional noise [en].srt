2
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:03,607
(soft clops and bounces)

3
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:04,603
- Now it's time to think about

4
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,216
how to create natural
looking variation digitally.

5
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,515
(xylophone glissando)

6
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:12,282
- Well hello ladies. I'm back.

7
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:13,985
I have, as usual,

8
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:17,276
a few changes to the laying packet

9
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:19,589
and I thought you might wanna see it.

10
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,422
- Great timing.

11
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:21,775
We were just about to start talking about

12
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:23,190
skin and scale details.

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,376
- Great.
- Thank you, Tia.

14
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:25,842
- [Tia] You're welcome. Good luck!

15
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:26,675
- [Brunette Woman] Thanks.

16
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:27,508
- [Curly Haired Woman] See here,

17
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:30,399
she's added a pattern
reference for skin and scales.

18
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,343
- [Brunette Woman] It kinda reminds me

19
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,815
of the variation you see in clouds.

20
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:36,379
I noticed there's both color variation,

21
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,799
from green to yellow,

22
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,540
as well as brightness variation,

23
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,564
from dark to bright.

24
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:42,397
- [Curly Haired Woman] I noticed the skin

25
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,039
has a different pattern
compared to the scales.

26
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,941
It seems smoother and darker overall.

27
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,852
- [Brunette Woman] To get started,

28
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:50,386
let's simplify our problem.

29
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:52,774
First focus on a single scale.

30
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:53,607
- [Curly Haired Woman] And imagine we cut

31
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:56,104
a thin strip across it like this.

32
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,825
Like a paint strip!

33
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,048
We can really see the
variation going on now.

34
00:01:00,048 --> 00:01:02,674
It flows from dark green to light green.

35
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:06,218
- Now our job is to represent
this mathematically.

36
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:07,052
- [Curly Haired Woman] In the computer,

37
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:08,197
the color strip is represented

38
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:11,153
as a sequence of colored cells, or pixels.

39
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:12,789
And the color of each pixel can vary

40
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,825
from light to dark green.

41
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,681
- [Brunette Woman] Like a
really long paint strip.

42
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,262
And it's the brightness
variation we want to express.

43
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:23,214
- [Curly Haired Woman]
It helps to think of this

44
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:24,797
as a 2D plot,

45
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:27,384
where the x-axis is the
position in the color strip

46
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:30,596
and the y-axis represents
the color of brightness.

47
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:31,430
- [Brunette Woman] Right now,

48
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,181
all the colors are the same

49
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,636
because we have a flat line.

50
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,808
No variation.

51
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:38,739
You can adjust the base color here.

52
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,572
- [Curly Haired Woman]
And the line is built

53
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,459
out of multiple control points.

54
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:42,293
If you pull them up,

55
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,040
it gets brighter in that region.

56
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,867
If you pull them down, it darkens.

57
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:48,534
This is known as a piecewise linear curve.

58
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:49,774
- [Brunette Woman] Very cool.

59
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:50,774
And check out what happens

60
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:53,962
if we scatter these points randomly.

61
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:56,081
This is getting closer to what we want.

62
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,641
One problem with this method

63
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:01,239
is that transitions currently
have a sharp boundary.

64
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,072
- [Curly Haired Woman] Yes,

65
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:03,910
but we can fix that by smoothing
this collection of lines

66
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,140
into a curve.

67
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,381
This is done using a subdivide slider.

68
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,610
- We covered how the
subdivision algorithm works

69
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,074
in our character modeling lesson.

70
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:13,031
(light clicks on)

71
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:15,384
(bright, glittery ring)

72
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:16,218
- [Curly Haired Woman]
But all you need to know

73
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:19,363
is that this slider defines
how much smoothing is done,

74
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:22,295
resulting in these more
gradual transitions.

75
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,003
- [Brunette Woman] By
manipulating the base color,

76
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,067
point positions, and amount of smoothing,

77
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:29,052
we can generate a whole
range of cool patterns.

78
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,877
- Now it's your turn to try this out.

79
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:31,955
In the next exercise,

80
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,839
your job is to match
different target patterns

81
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,420
by selecting the correct starting color

82
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,226
and defining an appropriate 2D curve

83
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,321
to define the variation of brightness.

84
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,154
- In this example,

85
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,836
we're using the curve
to control brightness.

86
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:43,723
But what other things that we can control

87
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,978
with a curve like this as well?

88
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:47,038
- We can really control lots of things

89
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:47,038
with these type of curves,

90
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,199
but one fun example is wings on insects

91
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,229
like dragonflies or grasshoppers.

92
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:53,880
We have lots of those in The Good Dinosaur

93
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,592
but in other movies like A Bug's Life,

94
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,104
obviously have bugs too.

95
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:58,202
And across the wing,

96
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:00,157
you'll have variation transparency

97
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:03,530
as well as color and iridescence
and lighting quality,

98
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,166
and all those can be controlled separately

99
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,000
by curves like this. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
