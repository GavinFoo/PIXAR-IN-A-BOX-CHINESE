00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,573
- Great work.

3
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:06,374
So far we define a curve which captures

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,699
the overall variation and brightness.

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,557
- The brightness depends
on the Y coordinate

6
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,314
or amplitude of a curve.

7
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,196
- But remember our goal is to capture

8
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:16,704
the patterns at different resolutions.

9
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,747
The first curve only captures variation

10
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:21,246
at low resolutions, think of it as

11
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,637
a broad stroke.

12
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:23,470
- [Lady Voiceover] So we need to add

13
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,635
higher resolution variation to our curve.

14
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:29,138
These are the smaller details
or changes in the amplitude.

15
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:30,967
- [Lady Voiceover] To do this, simply add

16
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,334
two curves together,
for example, take your

17
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,566
original curve and add
it to the second curve,

18
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,297
which would result in this final curve.

19
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:40,293
- [Lady Voiceover] Very cool.

20
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:41,776
Mathematically we are just adding

21
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,665
the Y coordinates together.

22
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,167
- [Lady Voiceover] Okay, we've updated

23
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,497
our program so that we can try this out.

24
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:50,064
At the top is the low resolution curve,

25
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,393
same as the previous exercise.

26
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:53,226
- [Lady Voiceover] And below it is

27
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:54,927
a new curve which is created by squishing

28
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:57,390
two copies of the original curve together.

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,833
It's a higher resolution curve

30
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,589
because it contains more detail.

31
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:03,161
Call this our medium resolution curve.

32
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:05,262
- [Lady Voiceover] And
we can keep doing this.

33
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:07,306
Here we've added a third curve.

34
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:09,052
It's defined by squishing two copies

35
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,126
of the medium resolution curve together

36
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,075
in the same way.

37
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,791
- [Lady Voiceover] This is
our high resolution curve.

38
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,061
It contains the most detailed variations.

39
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,171
- [Lady Voiceover] And
at the bottom we show

40
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,995
the results of adding
these curves together.

41
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:22,979
- [Lady Voiceover] I
see you have amplitude

42
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,052
sliders as well, that's fancy.

43
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,505
- [Lady Voiceover] Yes, this allows you

44
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:29,400
to adjust how much that
resolution contributes

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,220
to the final curve.

46
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,845
- [Lady Voiceover] Meaning
if the amplitude slider

47
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,180
is set to zero, then that
resolution is ignored

48
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,985
in the final curve, and if I ramp up

49
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:39,938
it really takes over.

50
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:41,105
- [Lady Voiceover] By
the way, this process was

51
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:44,652
invented by Ken Perlin
in 1988 and this is why

52
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:47,739
the variation is called Perlin Noise.

53
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:48,777
- [Lady Voiceover] His idea has been used

54
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,349
in almost every computer generated movie

55
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,670
in the past 20 years.

56
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,418
- Now it's your turn to try this out.

57
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,653
In the next exercise we
will test your understanding

58
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:58,151
of these multi resolution curves.

59
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,468
- Then we can move into higher dimensions.

60
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,775
- Do you have an anecdote
about Perlin Noise?

61
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:04,268
- Well in addition to surface shading

62
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:05,986
we all see as noise patterns to control

63
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,025
our hair grooms.

64
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:08,578
For example you use perlin and other types

65
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:10,853
of noises to control the length of hairs,

66
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,726
the width, the scraggle, comfing

67
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:13,803
and other parameters.

68
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:15,337
You can see it in almost
all of our hair grooms,

69
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,086
definitely Spot's hair
is a good one to look at

70
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:19,443
for that in The Good Dinosaur.

71
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:22,000
- [Lady Voiceover] Pretty neat. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
