2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:04,745
- So far we've been working with

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:06,684
Perlin noise in one dimension.

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,182
- But remember, the problem we really

5
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,884
wanna solve is in two dimensions.

6
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:13,249
- Luckily, we can apply
the exact same idea in 2D.

7
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:14,937
This part is really fun.

8
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,097
- [Woman 2] Remember, to
generate 1D variation,

9
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:19,786
we used a 2D curve to define the variation

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,874
of the base color along the line.

11
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:23,652
- [Woman 1] We used the
x component of the curve

12
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,533
to define the horizontal pixel position,

13
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,520
and the y component defined
the brightness of each pixel.

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,959
- [Woman 2] But to make 2D noise,

15
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,564
we'll need to start with a 3D surface

16
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,637
to define the variation across the plane.

17
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,539
Think of a 3D surface as
a collection of points

18
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,190
which have an x, y, and z component.

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,426
For example, here is a surface defined

20
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:42,094
by a bunch of random points.

21
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:43,850
- [Woman 1] Think about the x and y

22
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,698
coordinates of each point as the finding

23
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:48,108
the pixel position in a 2D
plane, and the z coordinate

24
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:51,624
will define the brightness of each pixel.

25
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:52,883
- [Woman 2] If we do that, we get

26
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:55,403
a 2D output which looks like this.

27
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,122
Notice the peaks of this surface result

28
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:59,940
in lighter points, and
the valleys are darker.

29
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,052
- [Woman 1] As before,
the output has very sharp

30
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:04,510
boundaries between light and dark areas.

31
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,700
That's because the surface isn't smooth.

32
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,805
- [Woman 2] Luckily we
can subdivide this surface

33
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:12,522
in the exact same way we
smoothed our 2D curve.

34
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,091
This will add new in-between
points to our surface,

35
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,310
resulting in smoother transitions.

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,370
- [Woman 1] And that gives us this

37
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,308
very natural looking variation.

38
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:22,085
It's exactly the kind of cloudy pattern

39
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,212
identified in the shading packet.

40
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:26,177
- You probably wanna try
this out for yourself.

41
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:28,150
In the next exercise,
you can try matching some

42
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,172
2D patterns using this technique.

43
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:31,964
- [Woman 1] We will give
you a target pattern,

44
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:35,052
and you can match this by
adjusting one the base color.

45
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:38,727
Two the resolution, this is how far

46
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,819
we zoom in or out of our surface.

47
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,758
Three, the subdivision, or how much

48
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:46,352
smoothing we apply to the curve.

49
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:47,849
- In this example we're manipulating

50
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,325
a few parameters to get our look.

51
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,921
But in a real production shading project,

52
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,327
how many parameters would you adjust?

53
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:55,390
- Well, background
characters would actually

54
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,812
be usually in the hundreds
but main characters,

55
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:02,361
like Arlo, you would have up to thousands.

56
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,584
If he's in mud, you would control

57
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,581
how much mud he gets,
or the color of the mud,

58
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,841
or how dry the mud is supposed to be.

59
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,619
He could have rain, and so you would

60
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:14,098
control maybe how fast it is,

61
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,925
or the different parts where
you want the rain to show up.

62
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:20,334
He could have bruises,
like throughout the journey

63
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,179
he gets bruises and he gets part of

64
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,770
the journey represented on his body.

65
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,473
And you would have controls
for all of those things,

66
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:32,596
besides colors or maybe
in certain environments

67
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,831
he looks a little bit
too shiny so you want to

68
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,645
bring the shininess down,
or things like that.

69
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:41,441
So there's just controls
for pretty much everything.

70
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,365
- [Woman 2] Sounds complicated.

71
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,000
