00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,013
- In the previous exercise you created

3
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:08,120
2D Perlin noise at a single resolution.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,491
- But remember, our goal is multiresolution variation.

5
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,966
Earlier we did this by adding 2D curves together.

6
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:14,833
- [Lady Voiceover] Which means we can add

7
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,828
surfaces together in the exact same way.

8
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:18,835
- [Lady Voiceover] For example, imagine

9
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:22,309
I took this surface and added it to this surface.

10
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:25,722
It would result in this final surface.

11
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,417
- [Lady Voiceover] We put together this tool to demonstrate

12
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:31,493
how we blend 2D patterns at different resolutions.

13
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:34,744
Let's start with a simple checkerboard example.

14
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:38,553
Here is a low resolution, a medium resolution

15
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:40,845
and a high resolution pattern.

16
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:44,729
This is the result of blending these together.

17
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:45,562
- [Lady Voiceover] And I see you've added

18
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,239
amplitude sliders to define how much

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,064
each resolution contributes to the final result.

20
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,814
- [Lady Voiceover] Yes, exactly as before.

21
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,913
You can adjust the base color too.

22
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:55,944
- [Lady Voiceover] Very nice.

23
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:57,719
Let's switch from this checkerboard to the random

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,970
patterns used in the previous exercise.

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,536
- [Lady Voiceover] Now we have the power to create

26
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:05,647
a whole range of different results, in fact,

27
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:09,212
I think we're ready to put this to work in our dino leg.

28
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,173
- Let's do it.

29
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,690
The final program extends what we did

30
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,247
in the previous lesson.

31
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,813
It generates a voanoy diagram as before,

32
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:17,485
however now we can define the pattern

33
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:20,151
applied to the skin and scales separately.

34
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,872
- [Lady Voiceover] Oh, fun.

35
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,431
Let me do a quick example.

36
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,480
In this main panel, I can adjust the scale size

37
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,387
as well as manually add and delete sides.

38
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:31,947
We covered this in our first lesson.

39
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:34,147
- [Lady Voiceover] Now jump over to the skin controls.

40
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:35,379
Here you can adjust the base color

41
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,804
as well as the brightness.

42
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,971
Here we have three sliders, one to adjust

43
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,266
the amplitude of the low resolution pattern,

44
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,486
one for medium resolution and one for high resolution.

45
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:46,503
- [Lady Voiceover] So there's a lot to play with

46
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:49,286
here to get the look we need.

47
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:51,349
- [Lady Voiceover] And the scale controls work the same way,

48
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,498
allowing you to create an entirely separate look

49
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:56,572
for the scales versus the skin.

50
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,321
- [Lady Voiceover] Notice we have two base colors

51
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:02,531
to select from here, color one defines the color

52
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,375
of the smaller scales, and color two defines

53
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,550
the color of the larger scales.

54
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,098
So any given scale will take on a color

55
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,872
in between your base colors.

56
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:13,753
- [Lady Voiceover] We did the same thing

57
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:15,075
in the previous lesson.

58
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:16,793
This will allow us to get some natural color

59
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:19,038
variations between the yellow and green Teah

60
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,057
had indicated in her reference arc.

61
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,206
- [Lady Voiceover] Exactly, and when

62
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:24,218
you're ready to test out your pattern

63
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,637
you can click here, Render in 3D.

64
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,282
It will wrap your pattern around a simple

65
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,553
leg to give you an idea of the finished look.

66
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,746
- Looking pretty good already.

67
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:35,536
Okay, we better stop here.

68
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,212
Now it's your turn to take over these controls

69
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:38,795
and create some of your own dino skin

70
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,204
using,

71
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,093
drum roll please,

72
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,429
(drum roll)

73
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,127
- See if you can match Teah's reference art

74
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:50,416
but then go wild and see what else you can come up with.

75
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,474
- What kind of things do you think about

76
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,799
when you're designing skin for characters?

77
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,690
- Well we think about a lot of different things

78
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,579
but when you're looking at the bumpiness

79
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,425
of each of the cells we felt like

80
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,527
if we were using a curve that was flatter

81
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:05,108
it gave the skin more of a look like it was

82
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,676
being used more in a harder surface

83
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:10,196
and therefore, it was an older character

84
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:12,837
and having the cells be more round, it felt like

85
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:16,587
it was a younger and fresher feeling skin.

86
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:20,924
We ended up in the actual skin packet, we used

87
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,785
a ramp from the center of the cell to the edge

88
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,513
of the cell and then we defined what

89
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:27,791
the curve was because we noticed that it

90
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,735
made such a big difference between having

91
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,482
that flat surface and the rounder curve.

92
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:33,315
- Interesting.

93
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:35,401
- So we were actually able to mathematically

94
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:38,774
define the curve itself with just the patterns

95
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,573
that we had inside each of the cells.

96
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:41,406
- That's really cool.

97
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:44,000
- Yeah (laughs). aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
