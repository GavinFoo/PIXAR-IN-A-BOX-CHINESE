00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,622
(footsteps)

3
00:00:06,622 --> 00:00:08,650
- We're on our way to the art department,

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,031
but we can't show you much of it

5
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,676
because everything there is super secret.

6
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:13,898
- In the previous video, we saw

7
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:15,525
how patterns were created to texture

8
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,452
the dinosaur, Arlo, for the
movie The Good Dinosaur.

9
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,834
In this lesson, it will be your turn

10
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,708
to make some convincing dinosaur skin

11
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,044
using patterns, colors, and randomness.

12
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:26,223
- (Tall Woman) We're
going to introduce you

13
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:29,358
to some techniques used
here at Pixar to do this.

14
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,352
- (Blonde Woman) Such as voronoi diagrams.

15
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:33,185
- (Tall Woman) And how we use randomness

16
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:35,836
to make it look more organic.

17
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,018
- (Blonde Woman) By the end of this lesson

18
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:39,021
you'll be ready to make
your own dino skin.

19
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,443
- And no matter what we're building,

20
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:42,356
it all starts with a shading packet.

21
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:43,290
- And the shading packet comes

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,012
from one of the artists in the
art department such as Tia.

23
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,532
(knocking)

24
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:51,874
- Hi!
- Hey.

25
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,335
- How are you guys?
- Great.

26
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:56,110
- Good, I have a present for you.

27
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,361
The dino leg shader packet.

28
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:02,331
There's a few pieces here for you.

29
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,154
Some reference, some color specs,

30
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:07,417
and some real reference.

31
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,349
Those are for the claws.

32
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:12,266
I don't have all the answers.

33
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,992
I'm leaving it up to
you guys to do the rest.

34
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,616
I've got to go run and teach a class,

35
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,492
so can I leave this with you?

36
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:23,055
And you're welcome to use my office.

37
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,199
Have a blast.

38
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,297
- Great.
- Thank you.

39
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,102
- Thank you! Bye.

40
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:31,611
- The shading packet is a collection

41
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:33,608
of drawings and images that will guide us

42
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:36,535
through the process of
creating our dino skin.

43
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:37,593
- (Blonde Woman) It all begins on paper

44
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,117
because it's much faster
to iterate that way.

45
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:41,419
- (Tall Woman) Shading
packets also contain

46
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:43,700
reference photographs like this cactus,

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,250
which is a real-life approximation

48
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,304
of the look and feel we're going for.

49
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:49,318
- (Blonde Woman) This is a wonderful

50
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,559
inspiration for the
scales of our dinosaur,

51
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,307
but it's just a starting point.

52
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:55,378
- (Tall Woman) Let's
examine these drawings

53
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:57,371
a little more closely and see what kind

54
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:00,220
of things Tia has identified.

55
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,400
- (Blonde Woman) First notice there are

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,762
a number of scales of
varying sizes sticking out,

57
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,715
or extruding from the skin.

58
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,915
We'll need to figure
out how to build these.

59
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:10,639
- (Tall Woman) Also notice
the scales vary in size,

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,119
some bigger and some smaller.

61
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:15,562
The bigger scales
correspond to rigid areas,

62
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,437
such as the middle of the leg.

63
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,575
Smaller scales are found
in areas near the claws,

64
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,631
which is an area that
is much more flexible.

65
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:24,935
- (Blonde Woman) Aside from the size,

66
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,607
position, and shape of the scales

67
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:29,740
we also have to start
thinking about color.

68
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,184
- (Tall Woman) Notice she wants each scale

69
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,792
to vary in color and a reminder to make

70
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:38,150
the skin beneath the
scales a different color.

71
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,150
- (Blonde Woman) The final touch

72
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:40,685
is to pay attention to different kinds

73
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,639
of random variations we'll need.

74
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,375
For example, some scales
extrude more than the others.

75
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,758
Plus, the position and size

76
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,636
of the scale should vary as well.

77
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,793
So there's lots of
variation going on here.

78
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:51,626
- (Tall Woman) Now it's your turn

79
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,529
to examine the shading packet.

80
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,281
- Once you're comfortable
studying shading packets,

81
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:59,000
we'll get to work creating
the patterns in the computer. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
