PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:04,032
- I grew up in Uruguay.

3
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:06,487
A little country between
Brazil and Argentina.

4
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:10,313
There's about three million
people in the country.

5
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,809
I did not have any experience. (laughs)

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,276
I came straight from school.

7
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,650
I have a duel degree in
electrical engineering

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,520
and fine arts.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,784
I am kind of right brain,
left brain, kind of person.

10
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:26,514
I really like arts and I
really like engineering,

11
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,459
and I found out there was a career

12
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,993
that you can combine both,
so I thought that was great.

13
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:35,356
And then I just happen to
interview with Ed Catmull,

14
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:37,486
was the president at the time.

15
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:40,237
I just thought it would be
great to meet one of the people

16
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:44,185
that had written some of
the stuff in my books.

17
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:48,334
And so I went for the
interview and I got the job.

18
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,002
When I went to college,

19
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,572
I was really interested in sculpting.

20
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:54,360
That was my main path.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,106
I worked a lot in clay, I worked on paper,

22
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:02,007
I worked on wire.

23
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:05,780
At the end of my career I started doing

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,255
a little bit of computer
graphics, but not a lot.

25
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:10,679
So when I came to Pixar,

26
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,036
of course I wanted to be an animator,

27
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:17,259
but the people that know best (laughs)

28
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,202
decided that probably a
technical director career

29
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:22,339
would be best for me, given that I had

30
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:26,043
the technical orientation
and the art, as well.

31
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:30,819
But the first one I did was
lighting TD on Geri's Game.

32
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,152
- [Interviewer] What do lighters do?

33
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:33,266
Lighting TDs?

34
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,212
- Lighting TD.

35
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:37,646
So if you can imagine a theater
and putting up the lights

36
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,837
wherever you want the character

37
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:41,527
to be looking pretty for the camera,

38
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:42,937
that's basically what lighting TDs do.

39
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,635
We are trying to emphasize the story

40
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,895
and what we want to get across,

41
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,325
and then make our things
look pretty, or scary,

42
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:53,867
or whatever they need to
be as part of the story.

43
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:57,374
And then I started working in shading.

44
00:01:57,374 --> 00:02:01,269
For shading, I did a lot of
prop shading, I did set shading,

45
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:05,145
and recently I've been doing
a lot more character shading.

46
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:07,485
And I also worked as a lead shading artist

47
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,300
for The Good Dinosaur.

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,092
Shading is basically creating
the material qualities

49
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,834
as you see in objects.

50
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,883
So when the models come to us,

51
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,896
they're basically just white plastic,

52
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,139
and we make them look the way
that they're supposed to look.

53
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,718
So if you have a piece of
wood, you want to figure out

54
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:27,240
what kind of pattern you want on the wood,

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,209
or how does the light
interact with the material.

56
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,200
If there's certain bumpiness to it,

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,776
if it's reflective, if it feels smooth,

58
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:39,656
or if the light goes into
the wood a little bit

59
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:41,473
and bounces around and comes off.

60
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:43,429
So there's a lot of math involved

61
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,839
into trying to figure
out that kind of system,

62
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:49,367
and how does the illumination
interact with the material,

63
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,859
and how do you perceive it.

64
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:52,390
And a lot of the times it's really funny

65
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,009
because the idea that you have mentally

66
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,797
of what the object should look like

67
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:58,627
is actually really
different from what you want

68
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:00,325
to put on the screen.

69
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:03,966
Sometimes I'm driving around
and I'll see a cloud on the sky

70
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,812
and I'll think to myself,
if I make that cloud

71
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,169
on the computer it will
look completely wrong,

72
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,206
and people would not believe it's a cloud.

73
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:13,550
But it's up there, it's in the sky.

74
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,955
So a lot of times you have to figure out

75
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:18,331
what our idea of the cloud is,

76
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,252
versus what the cloud really is.

77
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:26,747
I just like, for me cooking is almost

78
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,724
like a little bit of a travel experience.

79
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:30,925
It's an adventure.

80
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:34,603
So I tend to do really strange dishes

81
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:37,288
from what we're used to having.

82
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:41,097
Love using new ingredients and
stuff that I can't pronounce,

83
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:42,186
and just go for it.

84
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,634
Don't be afraid to say
you don't know something

85
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,330
because that's the only way you can learn.

86
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,413
Don't be afraid to make mistakes

87
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,997
because that's the only way we learn.

88
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:56,428
And just keep shooting
for what you want to be,

89
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:57,849
what you're passionate about.

90
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,044
That's really what's important

91
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:03,387
because that's what will
make you happy in the future,

92
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:05,000
just working for your passion. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
