00:00:03,216 --> 00:00:04,866
- [Woman] Now that you're comfortable reading

3
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:06,989
shading packets, let's get to work.

4
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:11,580
- To begin, let's step back and simplify the problem.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,161
A dino leg is essentially a cylinder,

6
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:14,206
with claws at the bottom.

7
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,156
- Let's ignore the claws for the moment.

8
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:19,450
- And if we unwrap the cylinder,

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,955
we get a flat rectangle,

10
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,501
or a 2D plane.

11
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,898
- We can do all the work like this in a flat plane,

12
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:27,600
and then wrap it up whenever we wanna test it out.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,390
Let's first think about the geometry of our dino scales.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,675
Each scale is an irregular shape,

15
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,837
and all of these different scales need to fit together

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,231
like a puzzle.

17
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:39,602
- At Pixar we use a really cool trick

18
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:41,260
to generate these kinds of patterns.

19
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,876
It's known as a Voronoi diagram.

20
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,119
It's based on a pattern we see all over the place

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,122
in the natural world.

22
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,491
From the spots on a giraffe, to the spots that form

23
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:49,786
when mud dries.

24
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,862
- And I love that we can explain the math

25
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,481
behind Voronoi patterns with bubbles.

26
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,182
- [Brunette Woman] If we fill a container with bubbles,

27
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,709
like this, they squish together and we get the same pattern

28
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:01,589
based on where the bubbles touch.

29
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:02,790
- [Dark-Haired Woman] Let's think about the geometry

30
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,252
of what's going on here.

31
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:07,150
We start by places a few points somewhere on the plane,

32
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,266
doesn't matter where.

33
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,479
- [Brunette Woman] Imagine they are tiny bubbles,

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,554
let's call these sites.

35
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:13,813
- [Dark-Haired Woman]
And then we blow them up

36
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:15,346
into larger bubbles.

37
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:17,004
- [Brunette Woman] Eventually the neighboring bubbles

38
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:18,773
collide at a single point.

39
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:20,640
As they expand, this grows into a line

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,897
where they squish together.

41
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:24,387
- [Dark-Haired Woman]
These bubble boundaries

42
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:26,212
is where we draw our lines.

43
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:27,788
- [Brunette Woman] And watch what happens when we do this

44
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,561
with many sites scattered about.

45
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,428
We get this irregular puzzle pattern.

46
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:32,793
- [Dark-Haired Woman] And that's it.

47
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,256
A Voronoi pattern.

48
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:35,830
- [Brunette Woman] Or Voronoi partition, if you really

49
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,959
wanna show off.

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,982
- [Dark-Haired Woman]
We'll call each of these

51
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,462
bubble regions a cell.

52
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,833
So we have sites and cells.

53
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:44,666
- [Brunette Woman] And there are some

54
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,264
really interesting properties here.

55
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:48,965
The border of each cell is always the same distance

56
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:51,126
to the two nearest sites.

57
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:53,369
- [Dark-Haired Woman] And wherever three lines meet,

58
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,601
we get a point, or a vertex right here.

59
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:00,446
And this is equally distant to the three nearest sides,

60
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:04,046
all thanks to the awesome power of bubble--

61
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:04,046
ah, math.

62
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,007
(both women laugh)

63
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,625
- Let's stop here and make sure that you understand

64
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,407
how to draw these Voronoi patterns.

65
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:12,068
- The following exercise will get you thinking about

66
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:13,518
how these work.

67
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:16,206
It's also a great time to grab a pencil and paper.

68
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:18,867
Remember, doodling is your friend.

69
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,735
- Do you have a good story about Voronoi patterns?

70
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:21,779
- I do.

71
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:25,304
When we were working on The Incredibles, we had this cake

72
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:28,717
that was absolutely beautiful, and it was made for

73
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:31,294
Bob Parr was gonna take a big bite out of it,

74
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:33,329
and it was full of these beautiful bubbles,

75
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,767
and the crest was shiny, and it was moist

76
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,592
and it was really really gorgeous.

77
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:40,002
And then the story changed a little bit,

78
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,830
and the shot ended up being filmed all at night.

79
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,530
- [Brunette Woman] So you can never see all those

80
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,992
beautiful Voronoi bubbles.

81
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,400
- [Dark-Haired Woman] Sounds delicious.

82
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
