2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,563
(lazy western music)

3
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:07,510
(clock beeps)

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,921
- What is the holdup?

5
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:12,127
- Ugh, shading artists at the salad bar

6
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:14,175
they just get a little too involved.

7
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,009
- Is it a fractal?

8
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,878
- I think so, that puffy shape repeats itself.

9
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:22,044
Oh, maybe we should talk about this somewhere else.

10
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,187
- I'm Beth, I'm a shading artist.

11
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,741
- And I'm Ana, I'm also a shading artist.

12
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,591
This lesson is about patterns,

13
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:31,521
which we use in shading all the time.

14
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,042
- Shading is creating the surface appearance

15
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,018
of all the stuff you see in our films.

16
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,360
Cars,

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,193
bugs,

18
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,063
trees,

19
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,256
aliens,

20
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:42,026
they all start out modeled three-dimensional objects,

21
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:44,988
but they don't have surface characteristics yet.

22
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,414
- [Ana] We create and apply the textures

23
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,804
that make our characters and sets

24
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:50,055
seem like they're made out of something real.

25
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,623
- [Beth] The word seem is really important here,

26
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:53,979
because we're not trying to recreate reality exactly.

27
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:55,990
- We're trying to capture the essential qualities

28
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,772
of a surface that make it feel believable.

29
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,855
- [Beth] And a lot of times,

30
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:00,688
that quality is actually a pattern.

31
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:04,209
(playful bongo music)

32
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,572
- When we begin creating a surface,

33
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,680
we usually start by looking at reference images,

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,741
or things from the real world.

35
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,046
- [Beth] We look at a few different qualities,

36
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:12,614
color, illumination,

37
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,342
which is how the surface reacts to light,

38
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:17,003
and displacement: how bumpy or smooth it is.

39
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,049
- Let's talk about how we did that with Arlo.

40
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:19,049
In The Good Dinosaur,

41
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,212
Arlo was supposed to feel young and fresh.

42
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,863
We actually used the succulent plant

43
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:27,131
called Titanoplis, as a reference for his skin.

44
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:29,706
Looking closely at the plant, we were able to deconstruct

45
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:32,657
what made it feel right for Arlo.

46
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,686
First of all, there was a series of cells

47
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:36,870
that formed the main feature of the pattern.

48
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,697
In terms of color, these cells

49
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:40,843
had one color in the cell itself,

50
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:43,398
and the ring around the cell was a darker color.

51
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:45,360
The surface of the plant was shiny,

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,764
but it wasn't a sharp shine, it was a soft shine.

53
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:51,423
Finally, the cells that made up the main pattern

54
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:54,947
were displaced from the surface, so it was kind of bumpy.

55
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,256
Once we figure out these main features,

56
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:58,873
we started creating a pattern.

57
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:01,030
However, to make the pattern feel organic,

58
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,584
we needed to do something else to it: add randomness.

59
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,812
- Believable randomness can be surprisingly difficult

60
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,381
to achieve in computer graphics.

61
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:10,830
Computers are great at modeling regular patterns,

62
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,300
but in nature, most of the patterns you see

63
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,490
have some variation or irregularity within their structure,

64
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,871
giving them a quality of controlled randomness.

65
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,886
- Getting that randomness into Arlo's shading

66
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:23,327
was a big challenge, but we used some interesting techniques

67
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:24,503
that we'll share with you

68
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,388
throughout the rest of this lesson.

69
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:27,706
- And you'll get to use randomness to create

70
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,597
and manipulate patterns of your own.

71
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:31,938
- I bet after this they'll all start looking at the world

72
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,404
like a shading artist.

73
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,058
- Hey, check out the bubble pattern in this baguette.
