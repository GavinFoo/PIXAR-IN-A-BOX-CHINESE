2
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:04,392
- Now that we're comfortable with

3
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:07,845
the geometry of our cells
let's flesh out some details.

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,618
Let's take a closer look
at the shading packet.

5
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:12,400
- [Red Haired Woman] Notice
each cell contains some skin

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,536
around the edge with the scale
sticking out in the middle.

7
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:17,436
- [Brunette Woman] We need
to decide how far it is

8
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:20,422
between the edge of the cell
and the start of a scale.

9
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:22,835
This gap will expose the skin

10
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:24,957
that the scales are growing out of.

11
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:26,458
- [Red Haired Woman] In
our program we can do this

12
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,788
with this parameter called scale size.

13
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:30,532
If we maximize the scale size

14
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,925
it covers all the skin which looks wrong.

15
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,385
So we need to pull it back slightly

16
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,018
to get the gap we need.

17
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:38,076
- [Brunette Woman] That looks
nice but notice the distance

18
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:41,084
between the scales is the same everywhere.

19
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,805
- [Red Haired Woman] Right,
that's not very natural.

20
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:44,082
We've added a control here to vary

21
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:46,906
the distance between scale edges.

22
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:48,878
- [Brunette Woman] That look perfect.

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,836
Next, we need to make the scales look

24
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:54,448
like they're extruding,
sticking out from the skin.

25
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:55,983
- [Red Haired Woman] In our
program we can control how far

26
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,278
they stick out with
this extrude parameter.

27
00:00:58,278 --> 00:01:00,313
- Now we have a model for our dino-skin

28
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:01,732
that we can start shading.

29
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,104
- Let's take a look at the shading packet

30
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,687
and examine the color notes.

31
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,852
- [Brunette Woman] It says
each scale should have

32
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:08,175
a slightly different color

33
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:11,715
and the skin should be
darker and leathery.

34
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:14,122
- [Red Haired Woman] So we'll
add some color controls here.

35
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:16,288
One for the skin and one for scales.

36
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,834
- [Brunette Woman] To pull this off

37
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,934
we have a really cool trick.

38
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:24,172
We define a range of colors
from the smallest scale, here,

39
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,803
to the largest scale, here.

40
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:28,257
- [Red Haired Woman] And now
our program will color each

41
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:29,927
scale based on its size.

42
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:33,467
So the smaller scales will
look more like this color,

43
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:36,226
and the larger scales will
look more like this color.

44
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:38,907
And all of the other scales
will be somewhere in between.

45
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,191
- [Brunette Woman] That's very cool.

46
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,726
It saves us time because we don't have

47
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,268
to define the color of
each scale individually.

48
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:46,726
- [Red Haired Woman] Now,
see how the color varies

49
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:49,031
very naturally according
to the scale size.

50
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,403
- [Brunette Woman] We also
added a preview button

51
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:53,980
to give us a rough idea on
how our pattern will look.

52
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,903
- Neat. Okay, now it's your turn to use

53
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:58,274
all these ideas to create
your own dino-skin.

54
00:01:58,274 --> 00:01:59,941
- And in the final exercise we can

55
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,503
use all the tools we
introduced in this lesson.

56
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:03,706
- And when you're happy with your creation

57
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,385
move onto the next lesson where we'll

58
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:07,505
be adding microscopic level detail.

59
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,609
This should really make
our dino leg look great.

60
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,562
Do you always have a model
first and then start shading?

61
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:13,521
- Most of the time we have the model first

62
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,883
and then we realize that
we need something that has

63
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,559
a little bit of a different geometry

64
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,137
and we wanna add certain details

65
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:21,099
in certain areas of the model.

66
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,895
So sometimes we end up changing the model

67
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:25,000
after shading has already started. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
