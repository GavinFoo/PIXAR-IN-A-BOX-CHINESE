PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:04,309
- Um, I grew up taking
art classes every week,

3
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:06,534
uh, on Saturdays in addition
to my school art classes.

4
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,108
So, I did a lot of drawing and painting,

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,080
and as I got older I
specialized a little bit more

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,827
in like photography and design work.

7
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,358
I think I've just always like puzzles,

8
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,967
and problems to solve,

9
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,487
and you know, it's so logical.

10
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:20,857
It just, it fits together,

11
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:24,160
and so, uh, I think that's
why I always liked math.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,160
There is an answer.

13
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,801
You can find the answer and solve it.

14
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:30,283
Well, I really didn't know that a job

15
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:32,442
like the job I have at Pixar would exist

16
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,761
when I was in college.

17
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:36,040
I studied graphic design
and I really loved that.

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,173
And then, when I was almost
finished with undergrad,

19
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,931
I stumbled upon an animation
studio in Columbus, Ohio

20
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:43,893
that was working on the movie Space Jam.

21
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,530
And the idea that somebody in my hometown

22
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,520
was working on a movie
was just amazing to me.

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,869
So, I showed up one day at their door,

24
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,067
literally knocked on the door,

25
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,364
and just tried to get an internship.

26
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:57,456
And people, nobody knew
what to make of me.

27
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,504
They were like who are you?

28
00:00:58,504 --> 00:00:59,337
Do you have an appointment?

29
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,431
And I was like no, I just
really want to work here,

30
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:04,447
and um, because I was
really eager and excited,

31
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:05,508
and they were impressed

32
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:08,019
that I was looking for
a summer job in January,

33
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,224
the year before, I got a summer job.

34
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,483
So I worked at that
studio which was called

35
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:15,117
Character Builders in
Columbus, Ohio for ten years.

36
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,507
And I worked on bunch of
TV animation, uh, projects.

37
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,759
As that was happening,

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,462
3D animation was becoming
more and more popular,

39
00:01:23,462 --> 00:01:25,293
and kind of more and more awesome,

40
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,139
and I really didn't
know that much about it.

41
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:30,575
And I was lucky in my second
or third year in grad school,

42
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:33,120
there were recruiters from
Pixar that came to my program,

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,428
which was a CAD at the highest university,

44
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:39,967
and I was offered a
technical director residency.

45
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,244
So when I finished my Master's degree,

46
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:43,616
I came to Pixar as a resident,

47
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,933
and I've been here ever since.

48
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,894
Um, I have been in shading and grooming.

49
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:51,122
I started here on day and night,

50
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:54,139
and um, started shading with props,

51
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,218
uh, characters, and some set pieces.

52
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:59,052
And I also started
grooming on that project.

53
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,158
And then I worked on several features

54
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,480
and shorts as a groomer,

55
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,034
and a character shading artist.

56
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,107
- [Interviewer] What does a groomer do?

57
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,970
- Groomers put hair and fur on things,

58
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,931
so if you imagine, you know,

59
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,012
if you give a dog a bath,

60
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,663
and all of a sudden it's
much, much skinnier?

61
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,058
The same happens with our animal models.

62
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:14,058
The bodies are much smaller,

63
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,423
and we have to put the hair on
to get the right silhouettes,

64
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:18,770
so grooming sometimes is a cross

65
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,586
between modeling and shading.

66
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:21,556
It's sort of like modeling,

67
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:23,775
because you're worried about
the silhouette of the character

68
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,192
and making their shape look correct,

69
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,331
but it's also like shading
in that you're responsible

70
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,949
for the surface quality of the object.

71
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,532
Um, one of my favorites was
Art from Monster's University.

72
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:37,144
He was a really fun challenge
because he's just like an arch

73
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,442
and he flips around all different ways,

74
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:40,496
so there are a lot of rigging challenges,

75
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,149
um, to get him to move the correct way.

76
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,381
And then to keep the hair looking right

77
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,442
with the little points
in all the right places.

78
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:49,406
That was a really fun one to work on.

79
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,436
Make as much work as you can.

80
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:54,126
Find as many people to hang
out with that make work

81
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:56,515
that you think is inspiring as you can.

82
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:58,566
Surround yourself with people
who are better than you,

83
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,000
because they'll make you
better at what you do. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
