PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:03,348
(clicking noise)

3
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:04,557
- Good work!

4
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:08,925
Now that we now how to
partition the space into cells,

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,449
we can write a program to
do all the drawing for us.

6
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,595
Plus my hand is getting tired!

7
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,277
- [Woman 2] Then you'll love this program.

8
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:17,229
It generates a uniform grid of sites,

9
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:20,338
then it draws the resulting
Voronoi partition for us.

10
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:22,511
- [Woman 1] That looks like a chess board.

11
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:24,563
If we shift every other line of sites,

12
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:27,433
we get this, like a beehive.

13
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:30,909
Definitely getting us
closer to the dino scales.

14
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:31,978
- [Woman 2] Notice it's following

15
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:34,357
the Voronoi rules we saw
in the previous video.

16
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:36,084
Any point you pick on these lines is

17
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:38,927
equidistant to two or three of our sites.

18
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,849
- [Woman 1] Okay, so how many sites

19
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,597
do we need, and where do they go?

20
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:46,163
- [Woman 2] Well, let's
check the shading packet.

21
00:00:46,163 --> 00:00:48,191
- [Woman 1] Our dino's
quite young, so she has

22
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,473
relatively few scales on her legs.

23
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:53,196
Perhaps five or seven would work.

24
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,875
- [Woman 2] There are more
scales around the claws,

25
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,484
but we can deal with that later.

26
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:57,575
What's important is that the

27
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:59,324
cells aren't all the same shape.

28
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:00,754
- [Woman 1] Yes, we have a subtle

29
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:03,384
variation in both cell size and shape,

30
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:07,703
unlike the perfect honeycomb
our program is generating.

31
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:09,884
- This is where the power
of random numbers comes in.

32
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,374
- But applying randomness
in a way that makes

33
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:14,328
organic look and variation
is really tricky.

34
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:16,654
Look what happens when
we scatter the sites

35
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:19,918
completely randomly and
then draw the lines.

36
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,406
- [Woman 2] That doesn't look right.

37
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,988
Way too clumpy.

38
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:25,163
- [Woman 1] Yes, it's too random.

39
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:28,500
We need more of a balance
between randomness and structure.

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,444
I think a Poisson Disk
Process will work well here.

41
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,474
- [Woman 2] It sounds fancy,
but it's quite simple.

42
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,477
It uses a new parameter we can control,

43
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:38,221
minimum site distance.

44
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,337
We can visualize this as
a disk around each site.

45
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:44,590
Think of this disk as the no drop zone.

46
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,067
- [Woman 1] It works like this.

47
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:49,537
A random site is generated,
then we generate another site

48
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:53,455
anywhere outside the disc,
and we repeat this over

49
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,215
and over until the plane is filled.

50
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:01,304
Notice it's a smoother way
of distributing the points.

51
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,236
- [Woman 2] There's much
less clumping happening now.

52
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:06,090
- [Woman 1] Watch what happens
when we draw the partition.

53
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,569
We get really close to the
geometry of the dino scales.

54
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:10,601
- Beautiful!

55
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:11,990
Okay, in the next exercise,

56
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,716
you'll have a chance to
play with these ideas.

57
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,037
- What was the most unexpected use

58
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:17,401
of randomness you've encountered at Pixar?

59
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:19,682
- I think the most surprising
thing about randomness

60
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,185
is that it's really everywhere.

61
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:23,804
Even in materials that you
might think are really constant,

62
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:26,968
like metallic car paint or
brick work or something,

63
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,651
let alone something like
human skin or dino skin.

64
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,916
There's really randomness in every

65
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,645
single material that we create.

66
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,616
(gentle orchestral music)

67
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:35,000
