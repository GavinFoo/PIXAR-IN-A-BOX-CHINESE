00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:06,551
- So, we've seen two ways
to calculate in-betweens:

3
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:09,463
linear interpolation and Bézier curves.

4
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:12,269
Now let's get into the math behind them.

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,817
We're gonna build on
some of what we learned

6
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,522
in the environment modeling lesson,

7
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:18,612
so if you need to review,

8
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:24,442
Let's start with the simpler
version, linear interpolation.

9
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:27,030
Let's focus on this segment.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,909
We know the value of y at frame 4 is 750

11
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:33,753
and the value at frame 8 is 190,

12
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:38,063
but what's the value of
y at frame 5, 6, or 7?

13
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:41,339
The picture tells us
that y can be represented

14
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:45,843
as a linear function of x,
where x is the frame number.

15
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:48,931
Linear functions can be written
in slope-intercept form:

16
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,729
y = mx + b,

17
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:56,390
where m is the slope and
b is the y-intercept.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,144
Now we don't know the slope
and intercept directly,

19
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,396
but we do have two points on the line,

20
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:05,989
which is enough information
to calculate them.

21
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:09,894
Now, once we have m and b,

22
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:13,075
we can figure out y for any frame.

23
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,456
Try out this next exercise
to test your understanding

24
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:19,000
of linear interpolation using
the slope-intercept form. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
