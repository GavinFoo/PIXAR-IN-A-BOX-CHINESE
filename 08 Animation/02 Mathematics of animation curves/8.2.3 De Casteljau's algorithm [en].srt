- So, how'd it go?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,973
Did you figure out how to extend a

4
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,643
Casteljau's algorithm to 4 points?

5
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:10,489
It's not so easy, so don't worry if you had some trouble.

6
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,903
Here's what De Casteljau came up with.

7
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:16,062
First, we use linear interpolation

8
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:18,442
along with our parameter t, to find a point

9
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,194
on each of the 3 line segments.

10
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:24,814
Now we have a 3-point polygon, just like the grass blade.

11
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:28,287
As before, we find a point on each of the new segments

12
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:31,084
using linear interpolation and the same t value.

13
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:34,671
Now we have a 2-point polygon, or a line.

14
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,040
We find a point on our line using

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,048
linear interpolation, one more time.

16
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,544
As we vary the parameter t, this final point

17
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,631
traces out our smooth curve.

18
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,349
These are the kind of curves we typically use

19
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,436
to control the motion of our characters as we animate.

20
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,224
We use something called a graph editor,

21
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:55,942
which lets us manipulate the control points

22
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:58,140
of these curves to get smooth motion between poses.

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,892
This is the graph editor that we use at Pixar.

24
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:09,909
In between each one of my key poses is a Bézier curve.

25
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,906
We also tend to group the adjacent segments so

26
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,459
they maintain the slope of the curve across the key frame.

27
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,779
This prevents sudden jerks in the motion.

28
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,544
You can use the next interactive excercise

29
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:22,215
to get some experience with Bézier curves

30
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,000
that have 3, 4, or even more points. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
