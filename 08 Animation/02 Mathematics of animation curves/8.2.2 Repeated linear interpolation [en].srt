 In Pixar BOX 

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,292
 We met a linear interpolation. 

4
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:08,918
 Now we'll smooth movements using Bezier curves. 

5
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:12,250
 Shape each portion of the curve determine the 4 points. 

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,125
 So how do you write an equation 

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,626
 which will give us a gentle curve on the basis of these points? 

8
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:24,792
 You might remember a similar problem with a lesson about modeling environment. 

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,417
 We tried to make curved blades of grass. 

10
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,709
 By three points określaliśmy parabolic curve 

11
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,834
 by <i> string art </ i>. 

12
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,459
 Recall this method. 

13
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,375
 Call points: A, B and C. 

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,667
 We also have the <and> t </ i> 

15
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,501
 determining the location of a point on the section. 

16
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,334
 First, we calculate the point on AB 

17
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:54,584
 using the concept of weighted average. 

18
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:57,082
 It's a different kind of linear interpolation, 

19
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,334
 but instead of the directional pattern 

20
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,042
 we use the model parameter. 

21
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:06,375
 The <i> t </ i> tells you how far we stretch. 

22
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,459
 When <i> t </ i> rises from 0 to 1, 

23
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,459
 our new point, call it Q, 

24
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,042
 moves from A to B. 

25
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,501
 Let's do the same for the second section. 

26
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,167
 Calculate the R point between B and C. 

27
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:26,167
 Finally, we apply the same method to QR 

28
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,250
 to calculate the P - a point on our average. 

29
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,501
 When <i> t </ i> rises from 0 to 1, 

30
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,667
 P draws a gentle curve. 

31
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,834
 You can consider this method to be repeated linear interpolation 

32
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:44,918
 because Q, R and P are calculated using a linear function of the <i> t </ i>. 

33
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:50,709
 The method of repeated linear interpolation algorithm is called de Casteljau. 

34
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:56,918
 Paul de Casteljau discovered this pattern a few years before Pierre Bezier 

35
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,501
 but he could not publish it before. 

36
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,125
 We have seen how to use the algorithm de Casteljau, 

37
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,876
 to form a smooth curve from three points. 

38
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,542
 The animation control curve using four points. 

39
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:12,524
 Take a piece of paper and a pencil and try to come up, 

40
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:16,000
 how to get smooth curve with four points instead of three.  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
