PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,209
 I looked into the lens. It's matter? 

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,626
 WHY COMPUTER GRAPHICS? How I came to Pixar? 

4
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:14,626
 Growing up, I was constantly drawing and painting. 

5
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:18,082
 Dad worked at IBM, so the house were computers ... 

6
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:20,501
 I remember when brother said: 

7
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,667
 "Look! The computer can draw." 

8
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:26,459
 I was like, "Ooooh! It can be good fun." 

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,417
 When I was little, my dad took me to IBM 

10
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:32,417
 a lecture by John Lasseter of computer animation. 

11
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,082
 Me speechless! 

12
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:38,250
 For the first time he showed Luxo Jr. - at least to us. 

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,584
 Zgniatał Luxo before you leap 

14
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,751
 and extended after landing. 

15
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,082
 How did you start? 

16
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,959
 I went to college information 

17
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:52,459
 and finished a course of visual arts. 

18
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:56,250
 The program concerned the arts, not graphics, 

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,459
 so nobody taught me animation. 

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,167
 She was a computer room in which little happened. 

21
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:06,459
 There have prepared their animated film. 

22
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,834
 SPATIAL FRAME 

23
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,501
 Well, just take a hat. 

24
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:02,042
 In high school I spent a lot of time learning math 

25
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,777
 and computer science in conjunction with animation, 

26
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,000
 but most I learned on the job.  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
