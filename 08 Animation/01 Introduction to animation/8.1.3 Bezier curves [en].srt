- You probably noticed that in order to get smooth motion,

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,869
you ended up having to pose the ball

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,652
in pretty much every frame.

7
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:18,168
The computer's helping, but it's still a lot of work

8
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:19,116
to get something that looks smooth.

9
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:22,857
Instead of linear interpolation,

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,853
we can use something called Bézier curves.

11
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:28,548
If you've ever used design or drawing software,

12
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:31,999
you've probably used Bézier curves without even knowing it.

13
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,155
This is named after a French engineer, Pierre Bézier,

14
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:36,722
who invented this method to describe

15
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:39,802
the smooth curves needed when designing cars.

16
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:40,957
These kinds of functions made up

17
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,602
of Bézier curves are called splines.

18
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:45,530
I also mentioned them in the first video.

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,636
Bézier curves come with these handles that let us

20
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:51,711
control the shape of the graph between our key poses.

21
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,804
We get this nice curve that eases out of the first pose,

22
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:00,494
and ramps down to the second one.

23
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,199
If you look at how these values map,

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,171
you can see something that looks just like our timing chart.

25
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,549
Now you try it out.

26
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:10,337
You should be able to get

27
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,631
much smoother motion using Bézier curves.

28
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:15,000
