00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:04,700
- Now that you get the basic idea,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,747
let's have a little fun with it.

4
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:08,093
We'll start by adding another control.

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,813
At Pixar we call these
"animation variables"

6
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,987
or "avars" for short.

7
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:18,315
This avar scales the ball out in X, and down in Y.

8
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:22,226
You can control the timing of this avar

9
00:00:22,226 --> 00:00:24,657
using the same graph editor.

10
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:27,871
Now we can make the ball stretch on the way down,

11
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,752
and squash when it hits the ground.

12
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:33,851
This idea of squash and stretch is one of the

13
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,329
key principles of animation.

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,258
Animating the squash and stretch of an object

15
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:41,594
helps us to communicate what that material is made out of.

16
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,393
Remember, our job as animators isn't just

17
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:46,909
to move things around, it's to bring them to life.

18
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,275
And one way to do that is to show

19
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:50,983
the character's thought process.

20
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,932
If this ball is alive, then maybe it's not just bouncing,

21
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,369
maybe it's hopping.

22
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,969
And before it hops it'll squash itself down in anticipation,

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,647
just like Luxo Jr squashes himself down before taking a hop.

24
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,833
This is some of the real magic of animation,

25
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,075
is that we can take something that's

26
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:10,221
fundamentally a lifeless object, and bring it to life.

27
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,087
(electronic squeaking)

28
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:13,626
(lampshade rattling)

29
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:14,657
(metallic whining)

30
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:17,434
(metallic sighing)

31
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:19,488
(wooden thudding)

32
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:22,141
(wooden thudding)

33
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,016
What kind of ball do you want to animate?

34
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,227
What's it doing?

35
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:27,806
What's it thinking?

36
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:29,000
