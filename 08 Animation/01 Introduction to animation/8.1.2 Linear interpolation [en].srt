00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,292
 In Pixar BOX 

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,792
 The method of drawing progresywngo works, but ... 

4
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,751
 it is often difficult to determine where we are going. 

5
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,542
 So let's start with the so-called. key positions. 

6
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:18,082
 For reflecting the ball to the highest point and the contact with the ground. 

7
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:22,167
 I'll start from the first frame, high. 

8
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,375
 Now cage 9. - a ball on the ground. 

9
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,876
 With these items, I Draw the intermediate frames. 

10
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,918
 The cage 5 is in the middle. 

11
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:37,792
 We call it breaking (<and> breakdown </ i>). 

12
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,209
 Dorysowuję cage, dividing the space. 

13
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,751
 Chart helps catch in numbers of frames. 

14
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,459
 Excellently! Wskanujmy drawings and odtwórzmy them. 

15
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:59,792
 Reproducing the same drawings back, we will show falling ball. 

16
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:06,834
 You can see movement, but hardly realistic. 

17
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,125
 It should first make a video auxiliary 

18
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,667
 for an idea of ​​what we're doing. 

19
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,959
 Remember, coming off the ball faster. 

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,209
 5. The cage is in the middle of the animation in terms of time, 

21
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,459
 but the shot should not then be in the middle of the road. 

22
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,918
 I'll draw the cage 5. differently, with the ball closer to the first position. 

23
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,375
 Let it be a 1/3 of the way down. 

24
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,396
 Animators have the visual system: time chart shows, 

25
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,459
 how to distribute the frames between key positions. 

26
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,709
 5. Thus the frame is 1/3 way between position 1 and 9. 

27
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,730
 Cage 3. Draw 1/3 way between 1 and 5, and so on. 

28
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,918
 Chart helps to deploy during the intermediate frames. 

29
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,000
 Recreate - and ball speeds, falling. 

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,501
 Let us now see how to apply the method with key positions in the computer. 

31
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,000
 We will start as before from the cage first with the ball in the air. 

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,167
 We jump to the cage 9, with the ball on the ground. 

33
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:19,876
 The computer shows us this graph. 

34
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:21,042
 Is a timing diagram; 

35
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:25,082
 We see how they are calculated intermediate frames. 

36
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:28,918
 On the horizontal axis is the time 

37
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:32,542
 and on the vertical - the height at which the ball. 

38
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:37,854
 Projecting the situation of each frame on a vertical axis, 

39
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:42,270
 We get the timing diagram as in animation done by hand. 

40
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,354
 The computer automatically connects positions of straight lines. 

41
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:50,082
 We call it linear interpolation. 

42
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:54,062
 The result is a uniform distribution of positions. 

43
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:58,292
 The reconstitution ball moves at a constant speed. 

44
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,542
 Now you try. 

45
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:05,792
 Make a convincing animation using linear interpolation. 

46
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:09,000
 Hint that you can add intermediate frames, where you want.  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
