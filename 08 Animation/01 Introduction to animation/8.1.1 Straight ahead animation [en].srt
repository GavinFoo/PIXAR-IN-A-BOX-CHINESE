PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:01,292
 In Pixar BOX 

3
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,918
 Before looking at the function of the spline, 

4
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,709
 I'll show you the animation department in Pixarze. 

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,792
 We are constantly working on films, 

6
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:14,125
 but the shoot does not exist. 

7
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,125
 We work at the computer. 

8
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,000
 It does not have to be boring. 

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,375
 Because this work requires creativity, 

10
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,792
 we try to Pixar creative favored. 

11
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,584
 Animation department consists of several parts. 

12
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:29,959
 With various offices. 

13
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,709
 Each part has a different style. 

14
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:36,626
 Here is a jungle. Lianas, leaves, lock ... 

15
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:40,334
 The room itself resembles an airplane wreck. 

16
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:43,125
 It is a meeting place for animators. 

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,000
 There is even a position to play live. 

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,125
 In my spare time I am a DJ, 

19
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:52,000
 So in his office I put vinyl and adapter. 

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,459
 First, I will show you several methods used in the animation manually, 

21
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:59,082
 and then to process it by computer. 

22
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:02,167
 We animate the ball using progressive redraw. 

23
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,417
 I'll start from the first frame. 

24
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,334
 I take a second card (thanks to the pins is equal). 

25
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,459
 I draw the second frame. 

26
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,375
 Now the third frame ... 

27
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,709
 And fourth. 

28
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,042
 As you can see, I draw frames one, in order. 

29
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,876
 When I'm done, wskanuję drawings and they can be played. 

30
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:33,876
 Drawing progressive computer works the same way. 

31
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,459
 Tested in an interactive exercise. 

32
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:41,209
 Przeciągnijcie the ball where you want to be at the beginning of the animation, 

33
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:44,709
 Move on to the next frame, and move over the ball. 

34
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,417
 In each frame a little further. 

35
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,709
 Just do so in subsequent frames. 

36
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:54,167
 When you're done, hit your "Play" to play the animation. 

37
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,000
 Let's see how you go!  aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
