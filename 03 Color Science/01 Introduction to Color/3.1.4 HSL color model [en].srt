00:00:00,525 --> 00:00:03,492
(metal clattering)

3
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:05,365
- You've just seen how any color

4
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,236
can be represented by blending together

5
00:00:07,236 --> 00:00:08,917
different amounts of three colors,

6
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,537
red, green and blue.

7
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:14,591
For example, the RGB
value of this gold color

8
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:17,271
is 100% red, slightly less green,

9
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:18,372
and no blue,

10
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:21,746
but as you may have noticed
in the previous exercise,

11
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:24,680
it's fairly difficult to
find the correct RGB values

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,776
to match a desired color.

13
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,596
So artists have developed new ways

14
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:32,149
to specify colors in a more intuitive way.

15
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:35,657
One popular method they use is called HSL,

16
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:39,106
short for hue, saturation, and lightness,

17
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,488
similar to the HSV we saw earlier.

18
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,280
Artists use a tool called a color wheel

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,280
to pick the hue and saturation they like.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,903
Hue is what we normally call color,

21
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:54,599
is based on the position
around this wheel,

22
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,347
such as this red.

23
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:00,680
Saturation defines how pure a color is,

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,470
and saturation is based on the distance

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,893
from the center of this wheel.

26
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,697
If we want to desaturate,

27
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:09,444
we move inward,

28
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,144
and if we want to saturate,

29
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:12,522
we move outward.

30
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,523
For example, to saturate
this shade of red,

31
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:18,614
we remove any contribution
of green and blue,

32
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,093
whereas to desaturate it,

33
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,120
we instead increase the contribution

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,119
of green and blue.

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,170
Taken to the extreme,
this trends towards grey

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,260
because the three color
contributions are equal.

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,069
So at full desaturation,

38
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:38,006
our red becomes achromatic, or colorless.

39
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,518
If an artist wants to use a strong yellow,

40
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:43,468
they first have to find
the yellow hue they want.

41
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:46,580
Then they move in the radial direction

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,279
to saturate or desaturate it.

43
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,137
Finally, there is lightness,

44
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,702
which is adjusted using a separate slider.

45
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:56,063
For example, we can take our yellow

46
00:01:56,063 --> 00:01:59,281
from very low lightness like this

47
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:02,495
to a very high lightness like this.

48
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,028
You can already see
that this is a much more

49
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:05,914
intuitive way of finding colors

50
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,631
compared to using RGB values.

51
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:10,175
Okay, let's pause here

52
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:12,220
so you can get the hang
of HSL color selection

53
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,000
in the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
