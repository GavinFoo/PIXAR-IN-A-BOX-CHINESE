2
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:05,317
- You may be surprised
that there is such a thing

3
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:07,238
as a color scientist, but at Pixar,

4
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:08,814
color plays a role in almost

5
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:11,156
every artistic decision that we make.

6
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:14,255
While this lesson will focus
on the science of color,

7
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:16,494
there is obviously a whole world of color

8
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:17,961
that artists think about.

9
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,940
Here we are in the color mastering suite.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,116
The equipment that we use

11
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,805
is basically a supercomputer
version of Photoshop,

12
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:26,634
but it kinda looks a little bit

13
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:29,807
like the Star Trek Enterprise.

14
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,863
My goal in this lesson is to show you that

15
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:35,372
color is really part physics
and part human perception,

16
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,220
and at the end of this lesson,

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,254
you'll have a chance
to manipulate the color

18
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:40,697
using scenes from our films

19
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:44,339
to achieve various artistic goals.

20
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:45,850
But first we need to understand

21
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,921
how the tools in this room work.

22
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,962
So let's go back to a simple question.

23
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:52,860
What is color?

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,632
Color is a property of light,

25
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:00,821
and light comes from light sources.

26
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:03,399
And there are all different
kinds of light sources.

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,833
For example, I'm currently
being lit by these lamps.

28
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,012
Without these, our scene
would look very different.

29
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:13,653
And using a flame as our light source,

30
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:15,016
like these two candles,

31
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,099
really changes the feel of the scene.

32
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,749
The light is not only dimmer,

33
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:21,229
but it emits a reddish-orange light.

34
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,337
Seeing this light on
a white piece of paper

35
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:25,037
is a great way to show this.

36
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:27,319
Try pausing this video and hold your own

37
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,283
white piece of paper up
to the screen beside mine.

38
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:34,076
Notice the difference between
my white paper and yours.

39
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:35,639
They're not the same, right?

40
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:38,144
Now compare how the same
piece of paper looks

41
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:41,343
under the most powerful light
source in the solar system,

42
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:42,459
the sun.

43
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,766
The sun gives off really intense light,

44
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,279
especially in the middle of the day.

45
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,167
You can clearly see that
the light on this paper

46
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,858
is much whiter than the candle light.

47
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:54,165
Inside, the light was more reddish.

48
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:56,211
So, where did the red light go?

49
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,509
Let's go back inside so I
can show you what happened.

50
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,581
The key is to think of all light

51
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,371
as a mixture of colors.

52
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,858
Sir Isaac Newton famously
demonstrated this

53
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,932
when he used a glass prism
to break up sunlight.

54
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:11,637
When sunlight passes in
and out of the prism,

55
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:13,310
it bends, or refracts,

56
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,263
and splits up into a spectrum of colors.

57
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:19,151
After Newton, other scientists discovered

58
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:22,002
that the light's wavelength
is what determines

59
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:25,130
how much it will refract,
and what color it will be.

60
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,996
Bluer light has a shorter
wavelength and bends more.

61
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:33,032
Redder light, with longer
wavelengths, bends less.

62
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,462
And this is the key point.

63
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,889
Sunlight looks white

64
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,889
because it contains all visible colors.

65
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,568
Scientists have developed a 2-D graph

66
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,098
to easily visualize the colors contained

67
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,995
in any given light source.

68
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:50,241
In this graph, along the
X-axis, is the wavelength,

69
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:54,705
and along the Y-axis is the
intensity of that wavelength.

70
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:59,412
For example, here's the graph
of what daylight looks like.

71
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,288
This is known as the spectrum of daylight.

72
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:05,184
And a graph like this is called

73
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,425
a spectral power distribution.

74
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:11,724
And here's the spectral power
distribution of candlelight.

75
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,960
Notice it doesn't contain
the same intensity

76
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,795
of blue and green wavelengths.

77
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,265
If we shine candlelight through a prism,

78
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,426
we can't see a full rainbow.

79
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:21,627
The reds are strong,

80
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:23,800
but the blue wavelengths are much weaker.

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,452
Is this first exercise,
you'll have a chance

82
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:29,307
to explore the spectrum
of various light sources,

83
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,202
and answer some questions about them.

84
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:33,761
For example, what do
you think the spectrum

85
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,000
of a laser would look like? aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
