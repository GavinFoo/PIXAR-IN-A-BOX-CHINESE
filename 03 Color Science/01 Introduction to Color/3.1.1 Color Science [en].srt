00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:02,466
(chiming music)

3
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,523
- What do I think color is?

4
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,883
(laughing)

5
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,462
What is color?

6
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:11,562
(gentle cheerful music)

7
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:15,065
- (laughing) I can't answer that question.

8
00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:19,851
- (laughing) What is color?

9
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,250
Color is a sensation.

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,003
(chiming)

11
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,668
- Color is a very personal thing.

12
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:26,539
Color is very subjective.

13
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,644
It can trigger like a visceral response.

14
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,660
Like if you smell bacon,

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,529
ah, bacon.

16
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:36,703
You know, it's like if you see certain kinds of colors,

17
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,914
the same exact feeling.

18
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:39,747
- I don't know.

19
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:40,993
Ask some smart person here.

20
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:42,769
Pick-- (laughing)

21
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,479
- Color is a term that we use

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,601
to describe a collection of attributes,

23
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,832
hue and saturation and value,

24
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,887
that describes how we see things.

25
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:57,066
Hue is what the actual color is in the rainbow spectrum.

26
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:58,104
Is it more yellow,

27
00:00:58,104 --> 00:00:59,151
or is it more orange?

28
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:00,569
Bluer or redder?

29
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,273
Value is how bright something is relative to something else.

30
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,296
Is it white?

31
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,328
Is it black?

32
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,889
Is it some sort of middle grey?

33
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:12,953
Saturation is how intense the color is?

34
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:15,154
Is it more subdued and grey,

35
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:18,683
or is it more vibrant, almost fluorescence, you know?

36
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:22,151
A fully saturated color is quite eye popping.

37
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:24,583
(electricity crackling)

38
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,485
Color is everything to artists.

39
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,690
- It wasn't until I started working at Pixar

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,165
that I think I had to think about color

41
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,116
in a different way,

42
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:35,654
to apply it to a narrative

43
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:37,908
and it can mean something.

44
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:43,277
- On Up, there was a scene where Carl's house

45
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,343
got burned by Muntz.

46
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:47,601
It's really one of the lowest points of the film,

47
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,752
and it's this sunrise.

48
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,229
Normally sunrises are very beautiful.

49
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,488
It's the start of a new day,

50
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:57,652
but for this one, we wanted an angry sunrise.

51
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,608
It was just this beautiful tone of red

52
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,976
that was so dramatic for me.

53
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:03,934
I think that was really cool.

54
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,666
- Because the choice of color is so critical

55
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,429
to the story telling process,

56
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,822
it's really important that we understand

57
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:13,889
the science of the choosing of those colors.

58
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,223
The first thing to realize about color

59
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:18,572
is that color is really made up of light.

60
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,348
Light comprises different wavelengths of energy,

61
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,823
and when that energy comes through our pupil

62
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:26,454
onto our retina inside our eye,

63
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,983
it becomes nerve impulses, signals,

64
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,519
and eventually gets processed by the brain.

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,448
So the light is out in the real world.

66
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:35,997
The color only really exists inside your brain

67
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,082
when you perceive it.

68
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:39,455
(fireworks popping)

69
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:40,535
In the rest of this lesson,

70
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,261
we're gonna dive more into the science

71
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,904
and perception of color.

72
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:44,000
