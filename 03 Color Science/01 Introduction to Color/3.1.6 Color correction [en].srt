2
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:05,413
- I know, I know I promised you I'd give you a chance

3
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,782
to sit in my chair.

4
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:09,713
Well, now I think you're finally ready.

5
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:12,788
One of the final polishing steps in making a film

6
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:15,100
is the final color adjustments to every single frame

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,237
of the film, in order to increase its impact

8
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,112
on the audience.

9
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:20,771
And that's exactly what we do here

10
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,631
in the color mastering suite,

11
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,639
but it's not actually me who does it.

12
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:27,765
Let me introduce you to our colorist, Mark Dinicola.

13
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:28,598
Hi, Mark.

14
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:29,744
- Hi, Don, thank you for having me.

15
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:33,566
- Great, so tell me what is your job?

16
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,401
- I operate this color mastering system.

17
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,486
It's the tool set of a colorist, and a colorist

18
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:39,719
is responsible for actually making all adjustments

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,185
to a finished film.

20
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:43,212
I could show you an example on Ratatouille.

21
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:44,337
- Cool.

22
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,655
- So if we take this shot from Ratatouille, for example,

23
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,910
we might start by adding contrast,

24
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,147
then we might add some saturation.

25
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:57,239
Normally when I do this, the DP is sitting here with me,

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,685
and on this film, the DP was Sharon Calahan.

27
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,320
Perhaps we should ask Sharon to come in.

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,966
Hey Sharon!

29
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:04,468
- Hey guys, what's up?

30
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:06,413
- So on Ratatouille, what were some of the issues

31
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:09,093
and interesting facts that came up while you were doing

32
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:10,950
color correction on that movie?

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,499
- Well, Ratatouille was a film that had

34
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:16,511
a very unique, stylized look to it

35
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:19,125
that we envisioned in the very beginning,

36
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,486
and a lot of it is just kinda carrying it all the way

37
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,052
through to make sure the final product

38
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:26,364
looks as good as it can and has that vision in it.

39
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:29,313
And for Ratatouille, some of those things were

40
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:31,561
having nice, rich shadows, making sure that

41
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:35,149
there's adequate contrast and saturation in the scene,

42
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,268
making sure the eye looks where it's supposed to look.

43
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:41,352
But stylistically, one of the things that was really

44
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,830
important to me was making the human skin look good

45
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,380
and the food look really good,

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,876
and tying it all together, and one of the ways

47
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,055
that I use color correction to help with that

48
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:55,307
is to add a little bit of red to the darks,

49
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:58,727
the deep darks, so that it kind of tied the look together

50
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,806
and almost made the film feel like it was

51
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,688
dipped in chocolate a little bit.

52
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:03,522
- Very cool.

53
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:07,025
- I wanted the audience to leave feeling hungry.

54
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,223
- So guys, in this next exercise, we're gonna give you

55
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:11,148
a chance to make some of your own color adjustments

56
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,410
on these scenes.

57
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,714
To make changes to the entire image, press select + all.

58
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:20,881
And to adjust hue and saturation, and lightness,

59
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,801
and contrast, you can use these sliders.

60
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,977
We like using sliders because it allows us to make

61
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,401
very fine-tuned adjustments.

62
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,205
And instead of making changes to the whole image,

63
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:34,657
you can also select smaller regions in the image

64
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:35,941
to focus on.

65
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,758
To do this, press select region, and then click

66
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:43,533
around the image to define an area you want to adjust,

67
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,007
like this.

68
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,012
Once you've made a selection, your adjustments

69
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:50,533
to hue, saturation, and lightness, and contrast

70
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:53,068
will only affect what's inside this region,

71
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,346
and anything outside it will be ignored.

72
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:58,389
Go ahead and see what kinds of looks you can come up with.

73
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:00,150
Remember, the goal is to have fun

74
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,000
and explore what's possible. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
