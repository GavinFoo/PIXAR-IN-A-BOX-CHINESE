00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:05,140
- So far, we've been talking about color

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,118
in terms of wavelength of light and human color receptors.

4
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:11,104
That's the physics part of color.

5
00:00:11,104 --> 00:00:13,668
Now let's turn to the perceptual part.

6
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,211
We just learned that every color

7
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,174
has a hue, saturation, and lightness.

8
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:21,588
But colors appear in our world alongside other colors,

9
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,720
and that can really affect how they appear.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,970
It's also when things can get really, really weird.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,571
For example, look at this image.

12
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:33,958
Notice the two inner color rings.

13
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,626
The one on the left looks green.

14
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:37,657
The one on the right looks blue.

15
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:39,404
They're different colors, right?

16
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:42,003
No, if you take away the other colors

17
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,663
you'll see that they are in fact the same color.

18
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,589
And it's not only color which can trick us.

19
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:50,864
Different brightness levels will also affect

20
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,097
how we perceive an image.

21
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:57,158
For example, look at the following greyscale image.

22
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:01,591
Take a closer looks at these two squares, A and B.

23
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,357
One is a black square in the light.

24
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:08,013
The other is a light square in shadow.

25
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,777
Do you think they are different shades of grey?

26
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,523
Nope, let me show you.

27
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:15,488
They are in fact the same shade of grey.

28
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,048
So clearly not everything is what it seems.

29
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,529
How we perceive contrast or brightness

30
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:23,575
depends very much on the surrounding image.

31
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:26,296
And it brings us back to how the brain processes

32
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,179
incoming image signals.

33
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:32,108
The structure of our visual system is optimized

34
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,776
so that we can do important things,

35
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:34,254
like survive.

36
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:38,532
But a key survival trait is the ability

37
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,215
to very quickly identify danger.

38
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:42,556
This requires the ability

39
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:46,256
to rapidly refocus our attention when we need to.

40
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,028
Our brain does this by

41
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:49,899
automatically refocusing our attention

42
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,301
to dramatic changes in color, brightness or movement.

43
00:01:55,301 --> 00:02:00,258
We call this difference in color or illumination contrast.

44
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,045
Our brains are hard-wired to notice

45
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:05,453
when colors contrast with each other.

46
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:06,914
In the color mastering suite,

47
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:09,268
we can adjust the contrast of an entire image

48
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:11,663
using a contrast slider.

49
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:15,115
It works by increasing or decreasing

50
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,269
the differences in brightness,

51
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,116
or the illumination levels across the image.

52
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:22,792
For example, notice the left half of this image

53
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:27,258
has a lower contrast level than the right half.

54
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:29,247
Getting this contrast level right

55
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,499
is really important in Pixar movies.

56
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,288
For example, at the end of Inside Out,

57
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,151
in the headquarters there's a scene

58
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,399
where the character Anger gets really, really angry

59
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:41,553
and to sort of heighten this sense of him,

60
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,705
flames exploding from his head,

61
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,954
the surrounding area of the image is darkened

62
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,744
so that the contrast difference

63
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:50,978
is really quite extreme in that moment.

64
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,562
These kinds of decisions are made

65
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:55,202
by the Director of Photography.

66
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:58,694
And casually, we refer to them as the DPs.

67
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,848
Any decision that involves colors

68
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,893
or lighting of any kind will involve the DP.

69
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:07,222
Another great example is from the movie Toy Story 3.

70
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:09,491
Lotso the bear has sort of, in this whole sequence,

71
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,644
been the only really pink thing in the scene.

72
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:14,079
It's very much about an emotion of love

73
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,554
between Lotso's owner and the bear.

74
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:18,506
And then as the bear is lost,

75
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:21,020
there's a scene at the end where Lotso's looking

76
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,762
in the window at his owner and the replacement bear

77
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:27,119
and then what we're trying to do there

78
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,353
is sort of have Lotso, the original,

79
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,544
seem far less pink than the new bear

80
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,495
which is pretty much now the sort of center

81
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,931
of attention of love and heightening that perception

82
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,882
of the difference between how pink

83
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:42,723
each of them are was very much central to the emotion.

84
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,611
In the next exercise,

85
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:47,000
you'll have a chance to play with contrast. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
