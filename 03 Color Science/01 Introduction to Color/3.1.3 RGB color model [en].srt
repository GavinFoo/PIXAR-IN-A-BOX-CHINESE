00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,408
(light tapping)

3
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:05,138
- We've just seen the
beautiful rainbows you get

4
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,016
when you refract light with a prism.

5
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,171
Now let's think about
how we actually perceive

6
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:12,929
the colors of the rainbow
in the first place.

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,290
What makes yellow look like yellow?

8
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,059
Inside our eyes, we have
special color receptors

9
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,768
called cones, that are
sensitive to specific

10
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:23,307
wavelengths of light.

11
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:26,277
For example, one kind of
cone is most sensitive

12
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:31,225
to red light, so when long
wavelength light hits them,

13
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:33,925
that is from the red end of the spectrum,

14
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,974
they respond by sending a
corresponding electrical

15
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:38,845
signal to the brain, and
the magnitude of this signal

16
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:42,305
will depend on how much red
light is present in the light.

17
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:46,285
Our eyes have three main
kinds of color receptors.

18
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,694
One is sensitive to
the longer wavelengths,

19
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:52,729
redder light, one for medium
wavelengths, or greener light.

20
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,571
And one for shorter
wavelengths, or the bluer light.

21
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,443
The cool trick is our
brain blends signals from

22
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:01,904
these three receptors
to represent any color.

23
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:04,284
Colored television, and computer monitors,

24
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:08,333
borrowed this same idea of
color receptors from our eyes.

25
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,924
If you zoom into a computer screen,

26
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:14,655
you'll see it's made up of
tiny rectangles, or pixels.

27
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:19,485
Each of which contain a
red, green, and blue region.

28
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,934
To display colors, the monitor illuminates

29
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:24,755
these three colors accordingly.

30
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:26,717
To make the screen appear yellow,

31
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,604
the monitor turns on only the red and

32
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:30,953
green regions in each pixel.

33
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:33,914
From far away, these blend into yellow.

34
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:37,004
And that's how we can
digitally create any color

35
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:40,712
using just different amounts
of red, green, and blue.

36
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:43,764
In our next exercise,
you'll try to create a color

37
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:46,513
by mixing together different
amounts of red, green,

38
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:48,512
and blue on your monitor.

39
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:51,688
For example, to get this shade of green.

40
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,217
It's interesting to note
that other animals have

41
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,217
different cones in their eyes.

42
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:59,196
For example, dogs only have
cones that are sensitive

43
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:01,802
to yellow and blue, so red light doesn't

44
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,430
send signals to their brain at all.

45
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,241
The mantis shrimp, on the other hand,

46
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,968
holds the current record for the most

47
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,342
number of color receptors in its eyes,

48
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,662
12 different kinds.

49
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:13,268
And scientists still don't know how

50
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:14,632
they're all used to perceive color.

51
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,270
- Voila, he is clean.

52
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,411
(exciting fun music)

53
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:22,711
- Beyond that though,
there's also a certain class

54
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:26,699
of people, they're all
females, it turns out,

55
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,048
who we call tetrachromats.

56
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,722
They have four different
color receptors in the eye,

57
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:34,518
whereas the vast majority
of the population has three.

58
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:37,900
And so we think, and
expect, that their ability

59
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,006
to discriminate colors, to
basically tell the difference

60
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,938
between two very, very similar shades,

61
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,788
is probably much more precise
for the tetrachromats.

62
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:47,000
I wish I was one. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
