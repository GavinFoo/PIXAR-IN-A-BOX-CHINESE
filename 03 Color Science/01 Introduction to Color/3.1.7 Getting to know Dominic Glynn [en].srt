00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:04,885
- So, when I was in elementary school,

3
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:06,949
I mean, I studied math
like everybody else,

4
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:09,619
the sorta basics that
we learned at school,

5
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:13,907
and found that there's something about it

6
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:16,524
which it was greater than I am.

7
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:20,458
It wasn't that one person had decided

8
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,601
that this is how it was gonna be,

9
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,557
it was more that, collectively,
we'd kind of slowly come to

10
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:27,651
a better understanding of something

11
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:28,824
that has always been there.

12
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:30,097
And so, I really appreciated

13
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,913
and kind of was in awe of that idea.

14
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:35,348
And at the same time, I
was playing a lot of music,

15
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:37,316
I think, as a young kid,

16
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:40,291
and fascinated in how our ear

17
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,307
and our brain and our mind works,

18
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:44,436
given all of this kinda
stimulus coming in.

19
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,814
So, for me, it was kind
of a natural meeting

20
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,925
of these two worlds.

21
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:50,641
A little bit of math and a
little bit of perception,

22
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:55,076
you smash 'em together, and you
kinda land in color science.

23
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:58,287
Before I started working
in motion picture film,

24
00:00:58,287 --> 00:01:00,498
I did some challenging,

25
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,983
some people would say some
silly things. (laughs)

26
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:04,621
I used to engage in a
lot of mountaineering,

27
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,471
high-altitude climbing.

28
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:10,808
And on one of these
expeditions at high altitude,

29
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:14,172
I suffered an injury to
the retina on my left eye.

30
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:15,261
It's a retinal hemorrhage.

31
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:19,908
So, basically, the retina was
bleeding and became damaged.

32
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:23,156
And it wasn't painful,
but during the process,

33
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,831
I was completely fascinated

34
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,081
with what was happening
to my visual system.

35
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,625
I was able to sort of see,
oh, well something's not right

36
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,910
and this is different and new.

37
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,337
And then I was able to compare,

38
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:34,858
well, my left eye is
different to my right eye.

39
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:36,238
And if I kinda move my head this way,

40
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:38,726
I can see these weird things
I've never seen before.

41
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:43,653
And so, it was a weird sense
of kind of objective analysis

42
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,629
of what was going on,
despite the fact that it was,

43
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:47,212
in some senses, a medical emergency.

44
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:48,581
And we were far away from hospitals

45
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,677
and those kinds of things.

46
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,735
But that was probably
one of the turning points

47
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:55,750
where I recognized that,
wow, I'm really interested

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,810
in the human visual system
and what it can and can't do.

49
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,352
And, hopefully, we're using that now

50
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:04,043
in a way that's gonna help everybody.

51
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,156
Computer systems engineering

52
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:07,897
is the primary degree I studied.

53
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:11,252
Engineering is less about
the specific knowledge

54
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:17,279
and more about knowing
how to learn at speed.

55
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,470
So, a good portion of the degree

56
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,078
is stress testing your
ability to learn things

57
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,040
you've never thought of before

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,372
and then really put your
assumptions to the test in a hurry.

59
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:33,233
So, I consider the engineering
kinda like a mixed bag

60
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,372
of tools that can be applied

61
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:37,235
to a lotta different circumstances.

62
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:40,795
When I started with Pixar,

63
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,866
35-millimeter film was still

64
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,979
very much the predominant
distribution format.

65
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,227
You know, we used film projectors.

66
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:50,156
You had a xenon lamp and it shown light

67
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,359
through a transparency,
a color transparency,

68
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,543
up onto a huge screen.

69
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:57,972
The chemistry of the color of film

70
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:00,518
was very much a black art.

71
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:04,394
It was very sophisticated
and there were few players

72
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,699
in the field sort of supplying
the materials that we needed.

73
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:07,966
And so, for us to gain insight

74
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,777
into how better to
control the color on film,

75
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,681
it was a real challenge.

76
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:14,609
So, we went back to first principles.

77
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,744
We analyzed the film
at a really low level.

78
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:19,908
I mean, we kind of stretched
and pushed and pulled

79
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,055
in every possible exposure way possible

80
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:24,521
and measured everything that we could find

81
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,615
about the film until we came to, I guess,

82
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:32,550
a state where we knew more
about how to influence the film

83
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,999
than the people who were selling it to us.

84
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,247
We were able to do things with it

85
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,068
that they didn't even know were possible.

86
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:43,651
I am communicating with the artists,

87
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:47,048
the directors of photography,
the lighting leads

88
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:51,070
and the folks who are
responsible for implementing

89
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,044
the color decisions of the studio.

90
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:55,866
And I'm working with
them to better understand

91
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,105
what they're trying to achieve.

92
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,899
Often, this is one, two, three years

93
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,827
in advance of them doing the work.

94
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,815
They have an idea in their head
of what they'd like to try.

95
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:05,505
It might be something that
no one's ever seen before.

96
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:08,605
My job then is to sort of
translate those requirements

97
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,531
and turn them into a
pipeline or a platform

98
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,374
or a set of steps and processes

99
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,399
that we can gain confidence is gonna work

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,975
when the clock's ticking and
we don't have a lot of time

101
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,149
to sort of finish this work

102
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,564
or to sorta iterate many
times on a creative idea.

103
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:26,795
So, I kinda build the foundation
of the pieces necessary

104
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,838
to allow those artists to
really express themselves

105
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,334
in a way that's repeatable.

106
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,168
Things that are happening

107
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:37,175
in the world of motion picture film.

108
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,956
So, on the exhibition
side, you go to the cinema

109
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,459
and there's a digital projector today;

110
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,345
that's how we experience
our films on the big screen.

111
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,882
The next generation of digital projectors

112
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,661
is using red, green, and blue lasers

113
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,437
to illuminate the scene.

114
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:53,812
So, all of a sudden, we can get

115
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:56,803
these really, really saturated colors

116
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:58,108
way out on the spectral locus.

117
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:00,434
So, the most saturated things
that humans can perceive,

118
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,788
we can now create some of those
with these laser projectors.

119
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:06,206
And there's also new
opportunities, I think,

120
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:10,420
for some of our filmmakers to
potentially show you colors

121
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,894
that, quite literally,
you've never seen before.

122
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:18,507
Everything that you have a passion for

123
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:19,814
has a value in this world.

124
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,641
And people are gonna continue to tell you

125
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:25,146
that this is not cool
or this is not popular

126
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:28,117
or, in my case, it was math and music.

127
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:32,523
They still aren't necessarily
the most socially upheld

128
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:35,824
kind of revered pursuits.

129
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:39,651
But you can find a way easily

130
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,269
where that makes a real
difference for somebody,

131
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:44,798
that you can harness that passion
and turn it into something

132
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:48,000
that really makes a
difference in the world. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
