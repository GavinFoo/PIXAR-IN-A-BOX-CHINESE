- [Instructor] How many
different colors can you see?

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:07,796
Feels like an endless possibility.

4
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:10,253
Impossible to count them all, right?

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,995
Well, if we want to
represent colors digitally,

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:16,396
we have to find a way of counting color.

7
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,564
That is, for any given shade you can see,

8
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,920
we need to give it a unique
number or an address.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,996
Because numbers are something

10
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:26,275
both humans and machines can agree on.

11
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,283
One simple way we could do this is

12
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:31,845
to give a percentage for each color value.

13
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,202
We call this an RGB triple.

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,720
For example, 100% red plus 100% green

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,707
plus 100% blue is white.

16
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:45,735
0% red, 0% green, 0% blue is black.

17
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:50,342
Whereas, 100% red and 100%
green, but 0% blue, is yellow.

18
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:54,552
We saw this in lesson one.

19
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:56,927
Mathematicians love to represent things

20
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,300
geometrically or spatially,

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,959
so they came up with the
idea of a color space.

22
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,224
It's quite simple.

23
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:08,208
Normally, we represent a point
in three dimensional space

24
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,812
using x, y, and z-coordinates, like this.

25
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:15,944
But, instead, let's rename
the axes red, green, and blue.

26
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:19,172
And that gives us this color cube.

27
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:23,218
The key idea is this: every
point within this cube

28
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:24,896
represents a specific color

29
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:28,134
a projector or a computer
monitor could create.

30
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:30,795
So, remember all those colors
you were thinking about?

31
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,637
Well, any specific color you're looking at

32
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:35,459
will always be a point in this cube.

33
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,037
To help this sink in, we
have a color cube exercise

34
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,305
that you can play with.

35
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:40,000
