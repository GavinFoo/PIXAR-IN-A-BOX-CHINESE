2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:06,270
- Okay, so let's step back to the larger problem.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,907
Our finished movies are viewed

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,054
in a number of different ways.

5
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:12,485
For instance, the screen a movie is displayed on

6
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:16,974
could be a monitor, like this, or a projector, like this,

7
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:19,540
and that's where another problem creeps up.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,431
Both of these displays are getting the same color signal

9
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:23,439
of pure red.

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,053
Notice these resulting colors we see

11
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,677
aren't exactly the same.

12
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:30,347
The problem is display devices,

13
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:32,195
like monitors and projectors,

14
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:36,351
can only reproduce some of the perceivable colors.

15
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:38,775
It's the pure, or single wavelength,

16
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:42,423
red, green and blue light, they have trouble creating.

17
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:45,453
Notice, this screen can generate a slightly purer,

18
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:48,658
or deeper, red compared to this one.

19
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:51,711
Remember, on our CIE diagram that the purest

20
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:54,486
red, green, and blue are way out on the edge,

21
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:56,446
here, here, and here.

22
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,908
But, a typical RGB monitor can't create anything close

23
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:02,090
to pure red, green, and blue light.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,855
If it tries to display those colors,

25
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,955
the best it can do is hit three points

26
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:08,509
over here, here, and here.

27
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,330
And, since the display can blend those colors,

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,310
the device has the ability to create any colors

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,520
in this black triangle.

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,782
This region is called the Gamut of the display device.

31
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,535
It's the range of the perceivable colors

32
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:25,357
any give device can reproduce.

33
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:28,538
Mathematicians would say the Gamut is a subset

34
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,569
of the perceivable color space.

35
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,752
The size of this set is important to filmmakers

36
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:35,248
because they want the biggest palate of colors

37
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:37,164
to paint from.

38
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,566
More color means more artistic freedom.

39
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,306
For a long time, our movies were projected on film

40
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:46,464
which has a very large Gamut, like this.

41
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:48,426
Eventually, we moved to digital projectors

42
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:51,316
which had a different Gamut compared to film.

43
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:53,906
More recently, laser illuminated digital projectors

44
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:54,739
have been introduced

45
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,027
which have a much larger Gamut than film.

46
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:00,140
This is because they use laser light

47
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,776
which is very close to a single wavelength

48
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:07,221
allowing them to produce very pure reds, greens, and blues.

49
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,776
But here's a practical problem for you to think about.

50
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:13,200
How do we make sure our movies look good on any device,

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,779
especially if they have very different Gamuts?

52
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,381
You can think about that while working

53
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,000
on the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
