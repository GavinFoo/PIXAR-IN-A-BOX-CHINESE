00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,340
- Although RGB triples

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,343
are great for representing how we can generate colors,

4
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:10,055
they aren't natural for artists to use.

5
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:14,026
Instead, we use the concept of hue, saturation and lightness

6
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:16,779
to find the exact color we need.

7
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,615
On the hue saturation wheel,

8
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:21,067
the angle around the circle defines the hue,

9
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,802
and the radius defines the saturation.

10
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:26,121
The position in this circle is then combined

11
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,868
with the setting of the Lightness slider

12
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:30,528
to define a final color.

13
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:32,593
From now on I'm gonna call this Lightness slider

14
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:34,106
the Lightness Dimension,

15
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:37,463
since it only requires a single number to define,

16
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:42,104
and this color, which is defined using these HSL settings,

17
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:45,220
is also some position in the RGB color cube.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,120
That brings us to a key problem in this lesson.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,601
How does each HSL setting

20
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,992
convert into a unique point in the RGB cube?

21
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:59,911
First, let's think about how we can go from a 3D cube

22
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,926
to a 2D circle.

23
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:04,257
The trick is to think about where the grays are

24
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:05,649
in our color cube.

25
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,906
Anywhere in our color cube where the RGB values are equal,

26
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,166
we get some shade of gray.

27
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:16,578
For example, 20%, 20%, 20%, gives us this darker gray,

28
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,199
and 80%, 80%, 80%, gives us this lighter gray.

29
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:27,288
That means there's a line of gray within our RGB cube,

30
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,333
meaning that there's only one dimension needed

31
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,867
to describe all grays.

32
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,223
So let's rotate the color cube

33
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:38,631
so that we're looking directly down at the gray line.

34
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,085
Does it look familiar?

35
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:43,913
Mathematicians cheat a bit and deform this into a circle.

36
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:46,441
There's some fancy math to make this stretching happen,

37
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,163
but we'll ignore it here.

38
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:51,809
And that's where the hue saturation wheel comes from.

39
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:55,042
Finally, we can get to the Lightness Dimension.

40
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,590
To do this, we pop back into 3D space

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,524
by growing our circle into a cylinder.

42
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:04,349
The Lightness Dimension defines what slice

43
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,843
we take out of our color cylinder.

44
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:10,835
A Lightness value of 50% takes a slice out of the middle,

45
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:13,424
and to lighten the shade of any color on this wheel,

46
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,556
we're moving up the Lightness Dimension to a higher slice,

47
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:17,886
and to darken the color,

48
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,698
we move down the Lightness Dimension to a lower slice.

49
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:25,306
Okay, this is important, so let's pause here.

50
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,572
In the next exercise,

51
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:29,452
we'll challenge you to think about this model a little more.

52
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,000
Take your time and have fun. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
