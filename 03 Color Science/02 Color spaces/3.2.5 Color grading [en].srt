00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:02,316
(spring pinging)
(ball bouncing)

3
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:03,265
(lightbulb pinging)

4
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,257
- We've seen that every display device

5
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:07,152
can represent only a region of colors

6
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:09,064
within the perceivable color space,

7
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:11,262
and this region we call a gamut.

8
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,323
But inside the computer, where colors

9
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:15,757
are represented digitally, they're just numbers,

10
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:19,222
and they can represent the entire perceivable color space.

11
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,152
But when we send the film to a theater,

12
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:22,602
we need to match the color space

13
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:24,662
of the projector being used,

14
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:27,568
and that's the job of the color grading process.

15
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,917
It's to fill out the color space

16
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,239
available within that projector

17
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,845
and sort of constrain any colors

18
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,801
that don't fit within that device gamut.

19
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,425
And that's why I'm joined here by

20
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:38,799
Mark Dinicola, our colorist.

21
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,632
Hey Mark.

22
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:40,722
- Hello again, Dom.

23
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:41,891
- [Dom] So tell me about some of the different

24
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,132
types of grades that you do for a movie.

25
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:45,630
- [Mark] Well, we do the film grade;

26
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,174
the digital cinema grade, that's

27
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:48,952
for digital projectors in theaters;

28
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:51,247
as well as grades for home viewing in both

29
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:53,261
high definition and standard definition.

30
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,415
- So film versus digital grading?

31
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:56,304
What's that like?

32
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,054
- [Mark] Well, as you mentioned color gamut,

33
00:00:58,054 --> 00:01:00,625
the film has a totally different color gamut

34
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,312
than, say, digital cinema.

35
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,458
Especially film, the brighter saturated colors

36
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,553
aren't as available, so say on Cars 2,

37
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:10,893
where we had McQueen, a bright saturated red car,

38
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:12,805
we had an issue with the film grade.

39
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,191
We had to decide, is it more important

40
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,250
that he's bright and saturated,

41
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,877
or is better to have proper contrast?

42
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:20,709
- Wow, okay.

43
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:23,128
Any other stories or challenges on films past?

44
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:24,912
- Pretty much any film that has red.

45
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:26,735
Inside Out was an interesting one.

46
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:27,949
It was a very saturated film,

47
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:29,120
with so many different colors,

48
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,552
like Bing Bong is bright pink.

49
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:32,773
He tends to go brown on film,

50
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:35,675
so we had to carefully craft the grade for film

51
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:38,854
for that movie to make sure he stayed pink.

52
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,476
- So in the next exercise, you're gonna have a chance

53
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,768
to explore what some of the different gamuts look like

54
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,312
with some scenes from our movies,

55
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:46,810
and we're gonna ask you a few questions

56
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,390
to make sure you understand the concepts.

57
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,650
Thanks for sticking with us.

58
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,000
Enjoy! aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
