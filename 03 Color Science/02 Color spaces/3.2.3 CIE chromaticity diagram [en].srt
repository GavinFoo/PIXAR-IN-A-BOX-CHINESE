00:00:00,525 --> 00:00:03,518
(springing)
(thudding)

3
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:05,875
- Now let's return to the
human eye for a moment.

4
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,545
Remember, the human eye is the sensor

5
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,795
which light must pass
through to be perceived.

6
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:12,954
So we need to understand the limit

7
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:15,233
of the human visual system.

8
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,102
In the 1920s, experiments were done

9
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:20,433
to map the color space
perceivable by humans.

10
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:24,055
From purple, all the
way around the rainbow,

11
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,581
to this red, this defines all colors

12
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,615
of a single wavelength.

13
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:31,663
These are known as spectral colors,

14
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,619
and inside this region,

15
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:37,162
we have all combinations
of those pure colors.

16
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,956
Scientists plotted the limit

17
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,838
of the pure colors we can perceive.

18
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:45,255
Notice it takes this funny looking shape.

19
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,247
One reason this shape is useful is

20
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,501
something called perceptual uniformity.

21
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,476
That's a fancy way of saying

22
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:54,120
that we can find the
mixture of two colors,

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,398
such as this red and this green,

24
00:00:56,398 --> 00:01:00,224
by simply looking at the
midpoint of them, right here.

25
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:04,010
It's known as the CIE
chromaticity diagram.

26
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,093
CIE refers to the scientific group

27
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,416
that published the findings.

28
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,543
Compare this to the hue
saturation color wheel,

29
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,742
which is not perceptually uniform.

30
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:17,076
Pure red is here, pure green is here,

31
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,377
but the middle of these two points is

32
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:20,328
not pure yellow at all,

33
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:22,855
it's a very desaturated yellow.

34
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:23,751
Okay, let's pause here.

35
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,054
In this next exercise,

36
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,438
we'll challenge you to think more

37
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:28,920
about this CIE chromaticity diagram,

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,000
and perceptual uniformity. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
