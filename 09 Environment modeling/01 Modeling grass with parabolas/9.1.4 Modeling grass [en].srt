00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,478
(clicking)

3
00:00:03,478 --> 00:00:04,452
Great work!

4
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:06,972
Now we've got all the math we
need for a computer program

5
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:09,448
to draw as many lines as we need

6
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,683
to create a good
approximation to a parabola.

7
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:15,376
Let's return to some of the
artistic aspects of grass

8
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:17,313
starting with the width.

9
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:20,213
In this interactive, I
can move the points around

10
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,785
and I haven't drawn the
legs of the control polygon

11
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,157
just to make it look a little bit simpler

12
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:27,348
and, let's see,

13
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:29,641
that kind of shape for the
spine looks pretty good.

14
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,419
So let me move on to the next step

15
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,446
which is to define the width.

16
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:37,989
I'm going to do that using
something we'll call a Skeleton.

17
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,641
The Skeleton is a set
of lines, like these,

18
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,055
that cut across the blade
of grass at 90 degree angles

19
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:46,529
so here's a Skeleton line,
here's a Skeleton line

20
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:48,143
and so on.

21
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:51,433
If I connect all the left
sides of the Skeleton lines

22
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,611
and the right side of the Skeleton lines,

23
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,773
I create a region, let me fill that in,

24
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:00,901
and that region looks a lot
more like a blade of grass.

25
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,407
(click)
(tinkling)

26
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:08,412
I can control the width
using this slider here

27
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:11,953
so that's just adjusting the
length of those Skeleton lines

28
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:14,331
and that width there looks pretty good.

29
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,510
Finally, I can control the color.

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,151
I can go from a deep green

31
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:22,105
to a lighter green

32
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,025
to a really light green.

33
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:26,124
Our artists control parameters like this

34
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:27,788
to create the kind of convincing grass

35
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,223
that you see in "Brave."

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,977
Use this interactive to see what kinds of

37
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:33,970
blades of grass you can create

38
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,306
and then, in the next video,

39
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:36,000
we'll talk about how to animate it. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
