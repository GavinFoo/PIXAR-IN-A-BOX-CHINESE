 Hi, my name is Inigo Quilez 

3
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:03,967
 I'm working on Brave, 

4
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:07,907
 creating forests, trees and the environment as a whole in the film 

5
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,100
 and I use a lot of math. 

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,098
 I think most people think of mathematics 

7
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:16,263
 as something boring, mechanical, but 

8
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:18,807
 at Pixar we do not think so. 

9
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:24,539
 For us, math is a tool for creating images, movement, splendor, fun. 

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,459
 This lesson will focus on one of the places where we use mathematics 

11
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,189
 to create landscapes in Merida fighter. 

12
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,884
 Let's start with the simplest things you can find in this landscape - 

13
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:35,875
 blades of grass. 

14
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,431
 A blade of grass is something that begins at a point, rising to one side 

15
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:40,437
 and bent downward. 

16
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,804
 It looks like a small, narrow curve. 

17
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,949
 This is good news because the mathematics 

18
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:47,036
 It has a lot of tools to describe curves. 

19
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:49,922
 In this case, we chose a parabola, 

20
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,554
 which is a very specific curve. 

21
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:53,865
 The curve gives us, however, only the core, 

22
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:57,904
 Besides, we need to have a blade thickness and color. 

23
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:02,655
 And to fill the forest, we need to create millions of these curves, and give them 

24
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:06,262
 appropriate thicknesses, colors to make them look natural. 

25
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:08,560
