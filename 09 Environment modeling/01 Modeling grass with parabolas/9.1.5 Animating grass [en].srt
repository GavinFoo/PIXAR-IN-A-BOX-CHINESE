00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:06,179
- So far we've talked about how to create a blade of grass

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,810
using a parabolic arc and a width parameter.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,557
We refer to this kind of geometry

5
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:13,016
creation here at Pixar as Modeling.

6
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,809
We've also talked about how to create a color,

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,400
and we refer to that as Shading.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,030
Next we're going to talk about something even more exciting,

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,150
that is Animation, how to make the blade of grass move.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,618
Notice in this shot how the grass is moving gently

11
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:29,656
indicating a gentle breeze.

12
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:32,663
We call this kind of subtle motion Keep Alive

13
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:34,705
because if there was no motion at all

14
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:37,498
it would appear stale or dead.

15
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:39,124
But we don't want so much motion

16
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:40,292
that it draws attention away

17
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,723
from where the director wants you to be looking.

18
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:46,500
So how are we going to animate each blade?

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,683
Well to animate, I just need to know

20
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:52,604
where each control point is in each frame of the animation.

21
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:55,896
So, I can just record the motion as I move them around.

22
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:58,730
So here's a simple little animation,

23
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,229
and that's probably enough frames right there.

24
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,027
And now I can replay that animation

25
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:04,950
as many times as I like.

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,483
In this case, I'm just cycling

27
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,318
back and forth through the animation.

28
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:12,660
So, this is how this one blade looks when animated,

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,950
and here's how that motion looks

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,866
when it's copied out to a bunch of blades of grass.

31
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:17,872
Starts to give you a feeling

32
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,422
for how a field of grass might move.

33
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:22,209
But in this case, all the blades

34
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,627
of grass are moving exactly the same

35
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,964
which isn't very realistic,

36
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:29,209
but we can add a little bit of variation

37
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,601
by having each blade start the

38
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:33,262
animation at a slightly different time,

39
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,974
and that's what I can control with this slider here.

40
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:38,230
So, I can add just a little bit of variation,

41
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,526
or I can add a lot of variation.

42
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:43,238
And now it's starting to look a lot more realistic.

43
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:45,321
That's one way to add variation,

44
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,367
but another way to add variation is using randomness.

45
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,492
In fact, we use randomness so often

46
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,197
and in so many different ways

47
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,870
that we're going to devote an entire tutorial to it.

48
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,739
But for now, use this interactive

49
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:59,208
to see if you can animate two different shots.

50
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,666
One with just a little bit of gentle Keep Alive

51
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,129
like on a calm day,

52
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,000
and another that looks like a very windy or stormy day. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
