PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,355
- Well as a child I grew up

3
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:06,261
in the age of Apollo, the moon mission.

4
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:09,143
So I always knew I wanted to go into science.

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,495
First I thought I wanted to be

6
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:12,720
an astronaut like everybody my age.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,272
I didn't really discover mathematics

8
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:15,692
until I was in 7th grade.

9
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,870
I was building model rockets at the time

10
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,585
and my 7th grade science teacher showed me how

11
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,246
to use trigonometry to calculate

12
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:24,103
how high the rockets were going.

13
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:27,065
And I thought that was just so cool that I could, with math,

14
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:28,924
figure out how high something went

15
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:31,233
without having to get a big ladder or a ruler.

16
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,675
And then in graduate school I discovered that you could

17
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,423
put math, science, and computers together.

18
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,055
That was computer graphics.

19
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:42,825
And I was lucky enough to be there really

20
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,586
at the beginning of computer graphics in the early 80s.

21
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:47,981
So I was hooked immediately.

22
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:52,342
After graduate school I went to the University of Washington

23
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:53,864
and started as a professor there,

24
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,320
where I started a computer graphics laboratory.

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,909
Stayed there for about 10 years but the computer graphics

26
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,983
community was really small at that time

27
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:03,562
and everybody knew everybody.

28
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:06,792
So I really stayed in touch with a lot of people at Pixar.

29
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,549
About 10 years after I got to Washington,

30
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:12,025
that was about when "Toy Story" was being finished.

31
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:13,709
And I thought, "Gee, if I'm ever gonna

32
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,288
"try something different, this is a good time."

33
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,389
So I did the unthinkable I left an academic position

34
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:21,583
and joined this little startup called Pixar.

35
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,938
When I got to Pixar one of the first projects

36
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:26,772
I got to work on was the short film "Gerri's Game".

37
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,004
Which was really exciting because it was a chance

38
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,787
to take some of the technology I'd been working on

39
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,377
at the University of Washington

40
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:35,637
and really apply it in the film industry.

41
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,468
It was really successful both creatively and technically.

42
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:42,188
It won an Academy Award for Best Short Film that year.

43
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:44,543
And later I won an Academy Award for the work

44
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,596
that I did on "Gerri's Game", the technical work.

45
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:50,510
The technical work I did on "Gerri's Game" is talked

46
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,575
about in the character modelling lesson with Alonzo.

47
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,388
It's the mathematics of sub-division.

48
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,528
So I've done various things at different times

49
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,664
in my almost 20 years at Pixar.

50
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,997
For the last 10 years I've been leading

51
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:06,590
the computer graphics research group here.

52
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,925
So it's our job to get out in front

53
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,544
of technology needs of future films.

54
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,343
We built a new hair simulator

55
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,364
for Merida in the film "Brave".

56
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:18,222
More recently in "Inside Out" one of the researchers

57
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,855
Kurt Fleischer developed some new technology

58
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,934
for helping animators get even stronger

59
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,037
performances out of their characters.

60
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:28,216
Looking ahead over the next five to 10 years

61
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,597
one thing we're working on hard

62
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:31,275
in the research group is how to make

63
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:34,680
all these complex calculations go in real time.

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,479
That is at least 24 updates per second.

65
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,669
Right now in some areas, including simulation, the updates

66
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,151
can take minutes or hours per frame.

67
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,949
Getting into computer graphics these days

68
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,352
is so much easier then when I was a kid.

69
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,783
In fact, when I was a kid,

70
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:53,218
computer graphics didn't really exist.

71
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:56,038
These days if you're interested in computer graphics

72
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:58,256
there are lots of opportunities online.

73
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,709
You can go to Blender dot org for instance,

74
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,624
download a free software package that does

75
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:07,170
animation very much like the tools that we use in-house.

76
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,930
It's free, there are lots of great tutorials.

77
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,811
Using Blender you can get an idea

78
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:13,889
of how the artists here at Pixar work.

79
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,871
And then using Pixar in a Box you can

80
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,228
understand some of the mathematics that Blender requires.

81
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:24,306
Well for fun for the last 10 years or so

82
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,965
my two sons and I, in fact our whole family,

83
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:29,067
have been building kind of wacky projects

84
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,152
to take to this big event every year

85
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,180
in the Bay area called Maker Faire.

86
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,283
In 2010 for instance we built and eight and a half foot tall

87
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,593
animatronic fire breathing dragon.

88
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:40,876
Why not, right?

89
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:45,489
In 2012 we built a flight-simulator based on

90
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,607
the TV show "Battlestar Galactica".

91
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:51,920
And just this past year we took a powered exoskeleton,

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,488
kind of inspired by movies like

93
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,124
"Elysium" and "Edge of Tomorrow."

94
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:59,556
In those films the exoskeletons are props

95
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,597
and we wondered, "Hmm, could we build one

96
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:03,698
"of these things that actually really works?"

97
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:06,874
So my youngest son brought together seven of his friends

98
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:08,638
and we took something to the faire

99
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:11,000
that really put a lot of smiles on people's faces. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
