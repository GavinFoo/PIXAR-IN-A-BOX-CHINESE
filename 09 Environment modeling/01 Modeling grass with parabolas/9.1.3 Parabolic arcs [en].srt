00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,630
- Congratulations.

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,720
You're now an expert on midpoints.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,760
(arrow whooshes)

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,510
Now let's take the next step.

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,670
I've been claiming that the curves created

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,100
with the string art construction are parabolas.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,480
But how do we know that's actually true?

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,970
Well, it's actually a little bit hard to prove that

11
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,460
rigorously but we can get some intuition

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,190
in the following exercise.

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,320
Now you may have seen parabolic arcs

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,564
as graphs of quadratic equations

15
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,120
like this one, for instance.

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,039
So here I have a green curve that's the graph

17
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,079
of a quadratic function.

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,902
And so it's a parabola.

19
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,580
And I have a blue curve generated through

20
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,380
the string art construction.

21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,340
It's my job in this exercise,

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,760
it'll be your job in the exercise,

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,164
to see if you can reposition the points

24
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:47,720
so that the blue curve sits exactly

25
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,544
on top of the green curve.

26
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:51,770
So for instance, I'm gonna try moving this point,

27
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,020
say down here.

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,190
And this point over here.

29
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,810
Over there.

30
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,730
So the blue curve is getting a little bit closer,

31
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,480
but it's not exactly on top of the green curve yet.

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,750
And in fact I'm gonna ask you to try it

33
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,000
in the next exercise. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
