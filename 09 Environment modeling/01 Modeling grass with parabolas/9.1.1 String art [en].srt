PIXAR IN A BOX 艾墨镇 aimozhen.com/pixarinabox

2
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,810
Welcome to Pixar. I'm Tony DeRose, one of the computer scientists

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,510
who works on our film here.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,400
And conveniently enough, behind me is Mark Andrews,

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,690
director of "Brave."
Good to see you.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,420
So we're talking today about some of the ways that math is used

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,599
to create the forest in "Brave."

8
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:21,880
And I was wondering what it's like, as a director,

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,910
to work with the technical staff here.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,070
Oh, I love them.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,240
I mean, everything that you see on a screen

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,689
in a Pixar movie, we couldn't put out there without the technical staff.

13
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,320
Our movies are so complex.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,870
A movie like "Brave," the organics in it –
grass, the forest, her hair,

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,370
I mean everything –
that just ups the game

16
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,149
when it comes to the numbers that you're crunching in a computer.

17
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:50,550
So we rely completely on mathematics to make these movies.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,500
That makes my heart warm.
Thank you so much. Absolutely.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,440
And we're going to be talking about some of that complexity

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,579
in the rest of this lesson.

21
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,079
We saw in the previous video how parabolas are used

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,160
to model grass in "Brave."

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,519
A complete parabola is actually an infinite curve.

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,720
But we just want a little piece.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,920
That's called a "parabolic arc."

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,200
And to create believable grass, we have to create other attributes,

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,920
such as how the width varies up the blade, its color, and how it moves

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,000
in response to things like horse hooves and wind.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,220
And we'll get to all of that later in the lesson.

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,380
But for now, let's just focus on the basic shape.

31
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Come on inside.
I'll show you more.

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,310
So, the question is "How are we going to represent parabolic arcs in a way that

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,688
artists can deal with, but computers can too?"

34
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,989
There are a variety of ways of representing parabolic arcs.

35
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,989
You may have seen them, for instance, as graphs of quadratic functions.

36
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:48,450
The problem with quadratic functions is they're not very intuitive for artists.

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,930
A more artist-friendly way is to use 3 points.

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,590
Let me show you. Okay.
So I have 3 points.

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,819
And as I move them around, the parabola updates accordingly.

40
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,099
And in computer graphics, these 3 points like this

41
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,259
are called a "control polygon."

42
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,259
So if I'm only going to store the 3 points,

43
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,550
I somehow have to recover that parabolic arc.

44
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,500
So the question is
"How do I go from these 3 points

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,470
to recovering my parabola?"

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,759
The idea is pretty simple.

47
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,389
The first thing we're going do is lay out some evenly spaced points –

48
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,000
the same number on each leg.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,940
And then next, what I'm going to do is start connecting dots.

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,060
And as I continue to connect these dots,

51
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,569
you'll see the curve start to emerge –
almost magically.

52
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,889
Now you can do this same construction in real life.

53
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,759
It's called a "string-art construction."

54
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,680
You take a piece of paper, you draw some lines on it,

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,860
you spread out some evenly spaced points, and then with needle and thread,

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,789
you start making these connections as I've done here.

57
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:50,310
So we'll call this the "string-art construction for parabolic arcs."

58
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,000
In the next exercise, you'll have an opportunity to connect the dots yourself. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
