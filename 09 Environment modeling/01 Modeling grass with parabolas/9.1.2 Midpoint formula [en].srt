00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:05,066
- In the previous video, we saw how to use

3
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:07,457
three points to define a parabolic arc.

4
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:10,197
Later we'll talk about how to define the width,

5
00:00:10,197 --> 00:00:13,471
the color, the motion, and the variety that would be needed

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,816
to create a convincing field of grass.

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,440
But first, let's talk about what math we would need

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,923
to create a computer program that our artists could use.

9
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:24,918
A program like this one, for instance,

10
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:28,377
where I can pull points around,

11
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:30,955
and the parabola updates.

12
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:34,252
So what kind of math is required underneath this program?

13
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:36,829
First we need to talk about computing the locations

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,780
of the points that we're going to connect together

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,218
with the string art lines.

16
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,145
Now, some of these points are a little bit easier

17
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,652
to construct than others, and the easiest ones are

18
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:47,696
the ones here, at the midpoints.

19
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:50,250
So this point here is on the midpoint of this leg,

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,686
and this point here is on the midpoint of this leg,

21
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:54,940
and so on.

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,517
So let's look at the mathematics of midpoints.

23
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,420
So here I have a line segment, A B.

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,608
The midpoint of that line segment is going to be

25
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,052
somewhere in the middle.

26
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,753
Like this yellow point here.

27
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:07,895
Let's call that point Q.

28
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:10,759
Now the question is, if I know the coordinates of A,

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,352
suppose the coordinates of A are A sub x, and A sub y.

30
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:22,066
Similarly suppose the coordinates of B are B sub x,

31
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:25,061
and B sub y, then the question is,

32
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:27,197
what are the coordinates of the midpoint Q?

33
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:28,916
Well, if you think about it for a minute,

34
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,633
you'll realize that Q is halfway between A and B

35
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,235
in the x direction,

36
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:35,905
and halfway between A and B in the y direction.

37
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,924
We can compute a point like that by simple averaging.

38
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:42,778
It is the x coordinate of Q is going to be the average

39
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:45,331
of the x coordinates of A and B.

40
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:48,443
So that's going to be Ax plus Bx over two.

41
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:54,202
The y coordinate is going to be Ay plus By over 2.

42
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:56,569
That's a very simple calculation.

43
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,148
^I can abbreviate it and make it look a little bit simpler,

44
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:03,922
^by writing Q as A plus B over 2.

45
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,667
^What this means is,

46
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,593
^take the average of x and the average of y.

47
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:10,334
^So these two expressions just mean the same thing.

48
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,749
Now our string art construction requires more

49
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,978
than just a pair of midpoints.

50
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,997
But we can create as many points as we want,

51
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:19,366
by computing midpoints of midpoints.

52
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:23,940
For instance, here is just a pair of midpoints,

53
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,423
and now I'm going to compute a midpoint on this subsegment,

54
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,327
and another midpoint on this subsegment.

55
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:31,858
Similarly for these two subsegments.

56
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:34,203
So that gives me three points on each leg,

57
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,502
and I can create as many as I want just by continuing

58
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:40,054
this midpoint of midpoint process.

59
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:43,000
Next, you'll have a chance to experiment with these ideas. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
