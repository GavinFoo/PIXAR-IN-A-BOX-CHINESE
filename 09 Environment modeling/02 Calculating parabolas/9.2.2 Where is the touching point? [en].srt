00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:05,241
- We're ready for step two in our search

3
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:07,413
for the elusive formula of how to compute

4
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:10,092
a point exactly on a parabola.

5
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,910
To gain some intuition, let's go back

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,900
to the interactive that we used to kick this all off.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,314
So here's my string art construction with a bunch of lines.

8
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,262
And now, let me cycle through the lines one at a time,

9
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:23,039
highlighted here in magenta.

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,919
So there's one of them, here's another one,

11
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:26,735
here's another one.

12
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,435
And each of these magenta lines can be described

13
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:34,328
by some fraction T that names that point on the line.

14
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:36,900
As I wiggle the magenta line back and forth,

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,094
notice that it continues to touch the parabola

16
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:41,973
in exactly one place.

17
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:44,517
Well if I can develop a formula for where that place is,

18
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:46,873
that's the formula I'm looking for.

19
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:48,440
We can see that even more clearly

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,218
in this version of the interactive

21
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,377
that you'll be using in a moment

22
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:53,560
to solve a couple of exercises.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,079
So in this version, I can use this perimeter T

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,994
to name which string art line I'm talking about.

25
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:00,921
And notice that each of the string art lines

26
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:04,397
touches the parabola in exactly one place.

27
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,679
In the next exercise, you'll be asked to come up with a

28
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,777
hypothesis for where that place is.

29
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:11,717
And the hypothesis, as a hint,

30
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:15,037
has something to do with the ratios of these subsegments

31
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,558
that are being created.

32
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,974
And we've color coded those subsegments to give you

33
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:21,096
an even more of a hint.

34
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,176
So see if you can figure out

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,000
what that special relationship is. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
