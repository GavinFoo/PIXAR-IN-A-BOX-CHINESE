00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:01,933
(steps and bouncing)

3
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,373
(switch clicks)

4
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:04,882
- You should now have some experience

5
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:06,972
in computing points on parabolas,

6
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:10,710
using the formulas that we wrote
down in the previous video.

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,985
These formulas are based on the hypothesis

8
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:15,702
that all of these ratios
are in the same proportion,

9
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,582
and that proportion is governed by t.

10
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:19,790
But now we're gonna prove

11
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,228
that these formulas are actually correct.

12
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:23,248
So I'm gonna use this version

13
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:25,384
of the interactive in the proof.

14
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:26,545
You'll have a chance to experiment

15
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,542
with this interactive in a minute.

16
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:31,189
And as before, I've got a string art line

17
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,141
that is controlled by a parameter t.

18
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:34,766
As I wiggle t back and forth,

19
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,157
the string art line
wiggles back and forth.

20
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,457
The method I'm gonna use

21
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:40,803
to find where the touching point occurs

22
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:43,054
seems a little bit sneaky at first,

23
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:45,190
but it's the simplest method I know.

24
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,557
And what I'm gonna do is
introduce another string art line,

25
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:51,645
this one controlled by a parameter s.

26
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,525
And what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna write down an expression

27
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:57,798
for this intersection point
here, this green point.

28
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,656
Now, why would I do that?

29
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:01,514
Well, the reason is, watch what happens

30
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:04,300
as s and t get closer and closer together.

31
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,947
So as I make s closer and closer to t,

32
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:09,733
watch what happens to
this intersection point.

33
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:13,542
OK, it moves, and it gets closer
and closer to the parabola,

34
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:16,653
and exactly when s equals t,

35
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:19,973
that intersection point lies
exactly on the parabola.

36
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:21,529
So if I can write down a formula

37
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:24,082
for where that intersection point is,

38
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:27,380
I can compute exactly where
the touching point occurs.

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,724
This is probably a good time
to pause and let you experiment

40
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,256
with this interactive to get some feeling

41
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:34,000
for what we're about to do algebraically. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
