00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,370
(tapping and cymbal beats)

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:03,370
- Great.

4
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,450
So hopefully you're closer to developing a hypothesis

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,230
for the relationship between the lengths of the segments

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,590
in the diagram that describe exactly where

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,290
the touching point is.

8
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,630
Now, recall that we're interested in the formula

9
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,810
for a touching point because that'll let us write a

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,610
computer program to compute just points on the parabolic arc

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,270
and not have to worry about where the string art lines are

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,490
or even where the control points are.

13
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,270
Let me tell you a little bit about how I came up

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,130
with my hypothesis.

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,910
So when we look at the diagram here

16
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,030
with t set to the midpoint, that is, we're talking about

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,510
a string art line that's halfway along the way

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,910
in the construction.

19
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,610
That is, this point is the midpoint of this segment.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,870
This point's the midpoint of this segment,

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,490
and finally, the touching point looks like

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,750
it's the midpoint of this string art line.

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,330
So, in this case, all those ratios are the same.

24
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,650
Let's go back to, say, t equals around a quarter,

25
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,049
so this point is a quarter along the way here,

26
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,810
this point is a quarter along the way here,

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,121
and in this case, it looks like the touching point

28
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:09,049
is also a quarter along the way of the string art line.

29
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,489
So again, all the ratios are equal.

30
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,810
Let's try one other value of t, say,

31
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,830
something around 0.7,

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,290
so this point is 0.7 along the way,

33
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,250
this point is 0.7 along the way,

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,290
and again, it looks like the touching point

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,270
is about that same ratio, about 0.7 along the way.

36
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,650
That leads us to guess that if this point

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,290
is a fraction t along this line segment,

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,019
and this point is a fraction t along this line segment

39
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:35,760
that the touching point that we're after

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,640
is that same fraction along this string art line.

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,200
Now to turn this into formulas,

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,959
let's start by labeling our points.

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's call the control points A

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,160
B and C.

45
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,500
This point here on AB, I'll point Q.

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,840
This point here on BC, I'll call point R.

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,620
We'll call the touching point that we're after

48
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,440
point P.

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,780
So the geometry says that if this is a fraction t

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,220
along the way, that this in ratio t to one minus t.

51
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,580
This is in ratio t to one minus t,

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,599
and this is in ratio t to one minus t.

53
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,979
The algebra that goes along with this geometry

54
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,139
is that Q can be written as one minus t

55
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,120
times A plus t times B

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,419
because it's on the line segment AB.

57
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,139
The point R is on the line segment BC,

58
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,699
a fraction t along the way,

59
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,780
so it can be written as one minus t times B,

60
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,940
plus t times C.

61
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,460
If P is a fraction t along the line segment QR,

62
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,560
then it can be written again as

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,139
one minus t times Q

64
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,660
plus t times R.

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,580
So with these three formulas

66
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,520
taken together, we can compute any point on the parabola

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,360
we like just by varying the value of t.

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,060
The next exercise will give you some practice

69
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,000
using these formulas to solve a few problems. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
