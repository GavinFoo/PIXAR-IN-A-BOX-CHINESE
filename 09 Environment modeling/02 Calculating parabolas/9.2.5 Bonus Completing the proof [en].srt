(clunking)

3
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,669
- Thanks for hanging in there.

4
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:07,036
I know this discussion is getting a little bit technical,

5
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:08,858
but we finally have all the tools we need

6
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,834
to complete the derivation of a formula

7
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:12,818
for the touching point on a parabola.

8
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:14,630
But, before we continue, let's back up

9
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,197
just little bit, and remind ourselves

10
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:18,007
why we're doing this again.

11
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:20,179
Well, we need that touching point formula

12
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,198
so that shots like this in Brave

13
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,219
can be computed really efficiently.

14
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,438
Right, because that touching point

15
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:27,458
will allow us to write computer programs

16
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,698
to draw each blade of grass, without having

17
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:32,878
to draw all the individual string on lines.

18
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,296
So to turn this into formulas,

19
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:35,793
let's again label things.

20
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:39,648
So this light magenta line is controlled by the parameter t,

21
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,680
So I'm going to label, as before, this point Q

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,723
and this point R.

23
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:46,984
The dark magenta line is controlled by the parameter S,

24
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:49,446
so I'm gonna call this point Q prime,

25
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:51,722
and this point R prime.

26
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:54,217
Now, let's start writing down a few things we know.

27
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:57,480
Well, we know that Q is a fraction t

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,582
along the line segment AB,

29
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:02,960
which means I can write Q as one minus t times A

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,177
plus t times B.

31
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:09,520
Similarly, R is a fraction t along the line segment BC,

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,816
so it can be written as one minus T times B

33
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:15,765
plus t times C.

34
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:19,084
Similarly, Q prime is s along the way from A to B,

35
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:22,836
so I can write Q prime as one minus s times A,

36
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:25,959
plus s times B, and I can write

37
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,624
R prime, finally, as one minus s times B

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,016
plus s times C.

39
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,676
Okay, now this intersection point here

40
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,183
that we're looking for, P,

41
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,816
is somewhere on the line segment QR.

42
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,918
But where on the line segment is it?

43
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:45,438
Well, I'm gonna prove in a second

44
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,202
that it's at fraction s.

45
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,524
That is, I claim that P can be written

46
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:53,739
as one minus s, times Q,

47
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,069
plus s times R.

48
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:00,137
Now, if that's true, something nice happens,

49
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,318
because as s approaches t,

50
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:06,161
this expression here approaches one minus t,

51
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,901
times Q, plus t times R.

52
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,561
And that's the thing I ultimately want to prove.

53
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,837
So the only thing left to show

54
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:15,983
is that the intersection point can be written this way.

55
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,435
Why should that be the case?

56
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,545
What I'm going to do, is I'm gonna substitute

57
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,684
this expression for Q in here,

58
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,818
this expression for R in here,

59
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:26,061
and if I do that and rearrange,

60
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,022
I'll leave that rearrangement to you,

61
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,961
but the result is that P can be written

62
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:34,604
as one minus s, times one minus t, times A,

63
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:38,086
plus s times one minus t,

64
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:42,244
plus t times one minus s, times B,

65
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:45,657
plus s, t, times C.

66
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:49,045
And now, if I rewrite this,

67
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,205
using these expressions for Q prime, R prime,

68
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:56,139
I see I can write P as one minus t,

69
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,006
times Q prime, plus t times R prime.

70
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,730
Well, this expression says that P is somewhere

71
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,425
on the line segment Q prime R prime,

72
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:11,069
and this expression says that P is somewhere

73
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,449
on the line segment QR.

74
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,922
And the only point that can be on both line segments

75
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:17,919
is the intersection point.

76
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,870
So our proof is complete.

77
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,209
(bow stretching)

78
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,031
(arrow thumps)

79
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,000
