00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,860
- So far our discussion has been largely visual

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,200
and geometric and that's good because

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,071
that's how our artists think.

5
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:11,920
But at   Pixar we also have to create

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,540
computer programs and computers think best

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,484
in terms of numbers, equations, and algebra.

8
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,670
So somehow we have to bridge these two worlds.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,500
The worlds of images and geometry

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,400
and the world of algebra, numbers, and equations.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,680
In fact, this bridge between these two worlds

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,370
was one of the things that really drew me

13
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,590
into computer graphics in the first place.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,190
I find it really fascinating, how the algebra

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,862
and the geometry conspire to create beautiful art.

16
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,360
So what we're going to do is develop a formula that will

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,653
allow us to compute points exactly on the parabola.

18
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:47,780
And that formula will allow us to write computer programs

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,990
like this one, that will be able to draw the parabola

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,910
without ever having to draw any of the string art lines.

21
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,120
Our first step in the search of that formula

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,690
is to generalize the idea of averaging or midpoints

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,000
to the idea of weighted averages.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,888
So, let's look at our line segment AB again

25
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:08,250
but instead of wanting to compute the midpoint

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,420
suppose I want to compute a point M, say

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,742
right about here, that weights B twice as heavily as A.

28
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,520
There isn't anything particularly special

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,940
about weighting B twice as heavily as A

30
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,992
it's just a simple non-midpoint example.

31
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:26,051
So, the algebra would say that M

32
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,539
is one copy of A plus two copies of B

33
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,200
and then I have to divide by three

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,670
for this to be a proper average.

35
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,790
And I can write that a little bit simpler

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,272
as A plus two B over three.

37
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:46,180
And one final form is 1/3 A, 'cause there's

38
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,730
an implicit one here in front of the A

39
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,730
and there's a 2/3 in front of the B, so 2/3 B.

40
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,019
And notice that this 1/3 plus this 2/3 add to one.

41
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,360
And that's another way of saying

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,430
that this is a proper average.

43
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,543
So that's the algebra, let's take a look at the geometry.

44
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:08,479
Well, the geometry says that this length here, AM

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,960
is going to be in proportion 2/3 to this length here, MB

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,750
which is going to be in proportion 1/3.

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,720
Now, notice that the algebra says that the 2/3

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,530
sticks to the B, but the geometry says

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,941
that the 2/3 is opposite the B.

50
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:27,190
And that looks a little bit strange at first

51
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,639
but if you think about it, it kind of makes sense

52
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,500
because if there was a big weight in front of B

53
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,060
you'd expect this point to be very close to B.

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,530
Okay, well we can generalize this even further and let me

55
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,256
replace a 2/3 here with an arbitrary fraction, call it t.

56
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:47,870
So the t is going to stick to the B in the algebra

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,789
and now for this to be a proper average

58
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,849
I need to put something in front of A

59
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,370
so that something plus t is equal to one.

60
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,509
Well, something that when added to t is one

61
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,440
is a fraction one minus t.

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,199
So my expression now is 1 minus t times A plus t times B.

63
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,830
That's the algebra of this generalized situation.

64
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,620
The geometry is that this 2/3 gets replaced

65
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,900
with a t and this 1/3 gets replaced with a one minus t.

66
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,410
So let's get some feeling for this

67
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,667
idea by using this interactive.

68
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,190
So here I've got a line segment that I can drag around

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,000
and you can see the coordinates of A

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,060
and the coordinates of B and right now it's initialized

71
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,380
so that the point I'm computing is at the midpoint.

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,363
So I would have halves in front of each A and B.

73
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:36,110
But now I can slide this point around anywhere I like

74
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,520
along this line and that corresponds

75
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,824
to just changing the value of t.

76
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,690
So different values of t give me

77
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,280
different positions along the line.

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,090
In the next couple of exercises

79
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,419
you'll have an opportunity to get some experience

80
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,620
with the idea of weighted averages.
