00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,949
(clanking)

3
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:05,039
- There are many ways to tell a story.

4
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,456
And in simplest terms,

5
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:09,669
a story is a sequence of events, or narrative,

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:11,481
which unfolds through time.

7
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:12,314
It begins,

8
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,464
(soft music)

9
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:18,368
something happens,

10
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:20,644
(dramatic music)

11
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,981
(screams)

12
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,033
and it ends.

13
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,938
(soft music)

14
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:29,408
But, some stories, no matter how they're told,

15
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:31,863
have a special quality.

16
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:33,681
You've probably felt this.

17
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:35,539
Some stories grab you emotionally,

18
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,186
engage your mind and pull you in.

19
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:39,566
Now, let's hear from our artists

20
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,317
what stories pulled them in.

21
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:48,602
- These little stop motion specials on at Christmas.

22
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:50,576
And I remember seeing Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

23
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:53,886
for the first time, and I knew the song, that's one thing.

24
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,324
But then to see it

25
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,493
illustrated and play out in the city,

26
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:01,910
the Island of Lost Toys, how all these things were

27
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,477
not what people expected or not of the norm,

28
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,979
and I remember being very, very effective,

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,870
affected by the injustice, and that really

30
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,730
touched me as a kid.

31
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,985
- In the case of Little Mermaid, I remember

32
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:20,763
it was the first animated movie I had ever seen

33
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:24,431
that took me somewhere else, and I remember just like being

34
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:28,165
so transfixed with the idea of going under the ocean

35
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:32,140
and swimming, and living a whole kind of other life.

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,180
- A movie I saw

37
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,147
called The Killing Fields.

38
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,824
It was a war movie, and there's this whole section

39
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,610
of this movie where

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,492
the protagonist has to

41
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:46,515
escape from bad guys,

42
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,924
and it goes silent for like 30 minutes.

43
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:51,203
It felt like 20, 30 minutes.

44
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:54,232
And it's just so arresting to see this character

45
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:57,013
trying to survive that I was just riveted.

46
00:01:57,013 --> 00:02:00,754
And when he finally finds his friend at the end like,

47
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,851
I just remember, yeah, like breaking down.

48
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:06,578
It was, felt incredibly emotional.

49
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:08,261
- The Lion King.

50
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,431
And I remember I was five years old and watching

51
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,919
Mufasa fall to his death,

52
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,263
and I was so traumatized that I had to leave the theater.

53
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,420
It hadn't hit me before, but when I saw Simba

54
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,437
nudging Mufasa's body, and he wasn't moving, and he,

55
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,871
Simba was telling him to wake up, but his dad like

56
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:31,488
wasn't waking up, and he just lay there.

57
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:34,924
And that like stayed with me for a really long time.

58
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,443
It traumatized me a little bit, but I think like

59
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,917
I grew a little bit after watching it, too.

60
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,679
- Imagine you're a castaway on an island.

61
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,895
You can pick three of your favorite movies

62
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,294
to bring with you.

63
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:48,228
What would they be?

64
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:49,061
(chimes)

65
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,062
In the next exercise, you'll have a chance to

66
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,197
think about what you would bring,

67
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:54,196
and why these particular stories

68
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,172
made such an impression on you.

69
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,792
You'll reference these three stories in the exercises

70
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,711
throughout the next six lessons.

71
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:04,000
