2
00:00:01,858 --> 00:00:02,776
- Hey Pete.

3
00:00:02,776 --> 00:00:03,668
- Oh hey Val.

4
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:04,930
- How's it goin'?

5
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,359
- You know what, I'm
havin' a really bad day.

6
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,713
- What happened?

7
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:10,741
- See what Val's saying when
she says, "What happened,"

8
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:12,739
is, tell me a story.

9
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,178
And that's actually what this season

10
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,955
of Pixar in a Box is all about.

11
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,490
To make a movie here at Pixar takes years,

12
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,983
but it all starts with a story.

13
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:24,894
Humans have been telling stories since we

14
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,388
could speak, probably before.

15
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,052
We tell stories around the campfire,

16
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:31,452
we write plays, we write
novels, short stories.

17
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:35,410
We make movies, we take
photographs, tweet to each other,

18
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,008
the list goes on.

19
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,244
The power of story is
that it has an ability

20
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:42,714
to connect with people
on an emotional level.

21
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,139
One of the things you hear all the time,

22
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,966
this advice, is write what you know.

23
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,619
Now, as a kid I was like, I don't want

24
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,580
to write about suburban
Minnesota, that's boring.

25
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,973
I wanna write about explosions

26
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:54,998
and monsters and car chases.

27
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,899
Well, what that actually means is,

28
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,300
yeah go ahead and write about monsters

29
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,846
and explosions and car
chases, but put something into

30
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:04,938
it that talks about your
own life, how you feel.

31
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,364
Do you feel scared?

32
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:07,931
Do you feel alone?

33
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:09,962
Something from your own life will make

34
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,498
that story come alive and not just be

35
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:14,168
a boring car chase.

36
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:15,090
- (mumbles)

37
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,221
- When I started directing
Monsters, Incorporated,

38
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:18,754
the way I would pitch it is, it's

39
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,605
about a monster who
scares kids for a living.

40
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:22,919
That's his job.

41
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,280
He clocks in, he clocks
out, he eats donuts

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,647
and talks about union dos, and we thought

43
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:28,655
that was a pretty funny idea.

44
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,630
And sure enough, when I would tell it

45
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,941
to people, they would smile.

46
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:33,596
But when we told the story as a film,

47
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:35,459
people started getting bored and restless

48
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,553
and they're like, "I don't understand

49
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,440
"what this movie's about."

50
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,447
Well, what I finally figured out was

51
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,587
that it's actually not about
a monster who scares kids,

52
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:45,757
it's about a man becoming a father.

53
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:46,824
(laughing)

54
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:49,379
That was what was happening to me.

55
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,547
So, why write about what you know?

56
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:53,983
Well, it's because, probably what happened

57
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:57,055
to you made you feel some particular way.

58
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,539
And what you're trying to
do really when you tell

59
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:02,595
a story, is to get the audience
to have that same feeling.

60
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:07,229
One of the big revelations
for me telling stories,

61
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,229
is how much work they are, really.

62
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,590
I always thought, you would just tell

63
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,275
the story once, and it would be perfect.

64
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,082
And geniuses like Walt Disney or Miyazaki,

65
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,093
this brilliance comes
out of their head once,

66
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,310
and there it is.

67
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,130
Well the truth is, our
stories don't always come

68
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,306
out exactly perfectly the first time,

69
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:27,563
or the second time, or the third time,

70
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,551
or the fourth time, up to the 30th time.

71
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,926
And so you keep going again and again.

72
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:34,170
And only after retelling the story many,

73
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,997
many times, does it really sparkle.

74
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:39,690
This season of Pixar in a Box is

75
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,425
about how we at Pixar tell our stories,

76
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:46,194
in hopes that it will
inspire you to tell yours.

77
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:48,343
- But, seriously, what happened?

78
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:50,477
- Oh, oh, so the first thing.

79
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:51,926
I get to my desk, right?

80
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:54,000
It's eight o'clock in the morning... aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
