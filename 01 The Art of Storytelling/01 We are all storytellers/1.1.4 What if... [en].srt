2
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,344
(metal clattering)

3
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:05,503
- Although our movies
involve hundreds of people

4
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:07,425
and take years to make,

5
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,506
they all begin with a simple idea

6
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:12,242
about some world and character.

7
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:15,516
- What if there's life
out there in the universe?

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,981
- What if a rat wanted
to cook haute cuisine?

9
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,665
- What if our toys that, you know,

10
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,544
are all around us actually were sentient

11
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:25,838
and can come alive?

12
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,197
- These what if questions
invite the imagination

13
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,900
into a story we want to explore.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,869
Let's hear how our story
artists use what ifs.

15
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,097
- So what if questions kind

16
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:44,621
of really drive that imagination.

17
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,088
- The best what ifs

18
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,442
are questions that sort of,

19
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:51,681
they feel like a key

20
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,961
that unlocks a door.

21
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,509
- It really shuts down the
logic part of your brain,

22
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:59,120
and it lets you engage the
dream part of your brain,

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,091
and somehow it opens up
the doors to imagination,

24
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:04,040
or at least for me it does,

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,277
and what if sort of seems
to ask this question

26
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:08,239
to let yourself wonder.

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,881
So when it came to writing

28
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:12,191
and directing Sanjay's Super Team,

29
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:14,021
the thing that I came to first

30
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,376
was what I wanted to say.

31
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,696
What if we could finally see

32
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:23,197
what my father was seeing in his mind

33
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:25,717
with his spirituality and his faith?

34
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:28,244
What if we could show that with vivid,

35
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,535
three dimensional, Pixar technology

36
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,559
to this little boy who worships cartoons.

37
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:34,690
That was the big what if

38
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,221
that I challenged the art department with.

39
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,221
- At Pixar, these what
ifs are not only fun,

40
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,550
but they're a simple way
to communicate a story idea

41
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,425
and kick off our entire creative process,

42
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,863
so it's important to be
able to communicate stories

43
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:50,200
in this concise way.

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,352
In the next exercise,

45
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,523
you'll reframe your three favorite films

46
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:56,000
in terms of what if statements. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
