00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:05,834
- Remember, the goal of this lesson is to get you

3
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:09,228
thinking of yourself as a storyteller.

4
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:12,321
As you'll discover, telling stories can be challenging,

5
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:13,856
so let's get a bit of advice

6
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:16,260
and encouragement from our artists.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,950
- My high school art teacher pointed out the drawings

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,861
of Michelangelo to me, and she pointed out specifically

9
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,517
that you see all these marks that he's left here,

10
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:28,393
these were the errors, these were the things

11
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:29,788
where he was searching for the right mark

12
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:33,350
and then he found the right line to draw the hand,

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,960
but he didn't have to erase them,

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,664
that was part of the search.

15
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:39,394
And it's okay, it's actually part of the process.

16
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:41,372
And so that's when, in fact, she was like,

17
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:43,817
"Get rid of your erasers, in fact, use your eraser

18
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,990
"to draw, not to get rid of something

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,043
"because if you're messing up, then at least

20
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,881
"you're sure that you're actually making progress

21
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:54,153
"to something that can be better than where you started."

22
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,978
- It's okay that your idea isn't perfect

23
00:00:56,978 --> 00:01:01,555
right out of the gate and it's just about identifying,

24
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,009
is there something there emotionally

25
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,075
that is drawing you to it and if there is,

26
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,057
then there's something there and you can just keep

27
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:13,480
working on it and changing it, but always remembering

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,158
what was that initial feeling that drew you to that idea.

29
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:21,200
- Ideas really, usually, when you first come up with them,

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,328
they're kind of more like notions.

31
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:28,197
That's kinda in the what if, what if hmm hmm hmm hmm?

32
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:32,682
And then the way you get to a solid actionable idea

33
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:34,852
is that you just keep working on it

34
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:36,852
and every time you do a version of it,

35
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:40,815
every time you do a pass on it, you get closer to the idea.

36
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:43,264
- It's a lot of hard work and it takes trial and error

37
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,985
to get that story right, because one thing that may

38
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:49,858
affect you and you have an idea, is not necessarily

39
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:54,006
going to speak to somebody else and that's where

40
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:58,772
figuring out the best way to get them out of their head

41
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:03,444
and intellectualizing what's being told them to feeling it

42
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:07,566
and getting in touch with their emotions so that they're

43
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,325
invested in what's happening to the character.

44
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:13,675
- The good news is that if you love it,

45
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,203
if you like telling stories, if you like communicating,

46
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,485
if you like drawing pictures, you won't wanna stop,

47
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,161
that's the great part, and even if it feels like

48
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,434
you're not making progress, you'll see a stack of drawings

49
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:30,435
or you'll see a bunch of pieces of paper

50
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:33,086
that have your words on them and I mean,

51
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,349
that's really impressive because you're making progress,

52
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,768
so you gotta keep practicing, it's as simple as that,

53
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:46,422
there's no easy way, and in fact it's really fun

54
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:48,401
if you really enjoy it.

55
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,892
- Hopefully now you have a sense

56
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,997
of a few what ifs you want to explore

57
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:54,960
and some worlds and characters to go with them.

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,441
And in the next lesson, we'll dig deeper into developing

59
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,000
characters and how we approach that at Pixar. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
