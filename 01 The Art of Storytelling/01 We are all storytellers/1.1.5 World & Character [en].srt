00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:05,247
- A What If statement is ultimately connected

3
00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:07,650
to a world and a character.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,117
When we say world, what we really mean

5
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,978
is the environment, or set of rules,

6
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:15,425
in which our story will take place.

7
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:17,951
It could be literal, like a coral reef,

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,071
or figurative, like the mind of a young girl.

9
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,877
Character, of course, refers to

10
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:24,620
the subjects or individuals we follow

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,284
on the journey of the story.

12
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:29,167
What if there was one less robot left on Earth?

13
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,217
Let's hear about some of the worlds and characters

14
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:34,649
that inspired our Pixar story artists.

15
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,474
Star Wars has this great What If question,

16
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,400
which is what if there was a band of rebels

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,037
that were trying to be the guardians of the human spirit

18
00:00:48,037 --> 00:00:51,599
and let's say there was this great war that was going on

19
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,875
between this non-feeling technology

20
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:58,431
trying to wipe out this kind of subtle human feeling

21
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:00,843
and it just has this great powerful What If question

22
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:03,697
that really drew me in to that world.

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,788
- The great thing about the world of Toy Story

24
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:08,546
is that it's this really beautiful metaphor

25
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:09,557
for growing up.

26
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:14,879
And it's so genius because it's so,

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,989
from the outside it looks so simple,

28
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,061
but from the inside it's so complicated

29
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,928
and so beautiful.

30
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:23,953
So I think that's a really good example

31
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:27,522
of a world sort of leading the story

32
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,325
and a world containing a metaphor within it

33
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,876
that we can all sort of grasp and hold on to.

34
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,267
- One of my favorite movies is Raising Arizona

35
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,596
by the Coen brothers.

36
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:39,941
Well, the world takes a backseat

37
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:42,162
to the character of this protagonist

38
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:43,959
who wants to sort of steal a baby,

39
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,511
so him and his wife could have this family.

40
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:49,276
That character is so incredibly alive to me

41
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,647
that he could just stand there on the screen

42
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:55,974
and it would still be really compelling.

43
00:01:56,974 --> 00:02:01,581
- Personally, I always think character should come first

44
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,916
and then the world comes after.

45
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:09,706
For example, a blind person forgetting his pants

46
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:12,654
and going to work will have a completely different story

47
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:16,116
than a seeing-eyed person forgetting his pants

48
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,336
and going to work.

49
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,747
Two characters will have completely different stories

50
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,735
but all of the objects and the setting

51
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:23,982
and everything else is completely the same.

52
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:26,592
So, for me, character is king.

53
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:27,967
- Everybody works a little differently.

54
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,251
So, for me, I like to come at it from world first

55
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:33,580
and then find the character to go into this world,

56
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,064
or who that character is going to be.

57
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:36,723
I needed to set the stage

58
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,119
for a bunch of other characters to go through

59
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,895
and then that was the equation

60
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,494
for stories to come out.

61
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:44,997
- Sometimes the world comes first

62
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,060
and sometimes the character comes first.

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,901
Either way, the story's born when both things,

64
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:52,751
world and character, meet.

65
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,120
Let's get warmed up in this next exercise,

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,901
thinking about characters and worlds

67
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,000
in the stories you love. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
