2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:07,494
- Hi, I'm Valerie Lapointe and I'm a story artist at Pixar.

3
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:09,207
I'm going to be your host for our

4
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:12,594
first lesson on storytelling, designed to introduce you

5
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:14,530
to how we tell stories at Pixar.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,208
Throughout the next six lessons

7
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,534
you'll have a chance to create your own stories

8
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:20,227
and you'll go from a rough idea

9
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:23,068
to having real storyboards like we use at Pixar.

10
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,397
Each lesson features Pixar story artists

11
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:28,357
sharing their insights about the story development process.

12
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:31,913
- My name is Domee Shi and I'm a story artist.

13
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,209
- Hi, my name is Sanjay Patel.

14
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,739
I'm an animator and storyboard artist.

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:35,898
- I'm Kristen Lester.

16
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,248
I'm as storyboard artist.

17
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:38,829
- Hello, my name is Mark Andrews and

18
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,950
I'm a director at Pixar Animation Studios.

19
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,858
The goal of this video is to remind you

20
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,938
that you already are a storyteller.

21
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,500
It's something we do naturally,

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,456
and start doing as children.

23
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:52,779
To kick this lesson off, let's hear how

24
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,572
some of Pixar's storytellers first

25
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:57,980
started telling their own stories.

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,962
- Out on the playground where you're

27
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:03,485
making up stories or playing in the backyard

28
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,892
where we're making up whole worlds.

29
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,516
From then on I started drawing my own comic books

30
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:12,230
and I would fake being sick to stay home from school

31
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,900
so I could draw my comic books and come up with my stories.

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,371
- What I did is I would take a drawing

33
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,354
of Betty and Veronica that was in the comic books

34
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,517
and I would trace it, and then I would draw

35
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,846
fashion on them, and I did this thing

36
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,932
called Betty and Veronica Fashions.

37
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,971
Somewhere in my mother's basement there are

38
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,830
thousands and thousands and thousands

39
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,944
of these drawings of Betty and Veronica.

40
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:35,081
- These poster assignments that my

41
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,030
art teacher would give me in high school,

42
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,926
and even in junior high school as well,

43
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,790
they were always around a theme

44
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,741
of American history, and so the idea

45
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,462
of this kinda homework of doing

46
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:48,031
American history in a visual form

47
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,465
was the kinda the first avenue

48
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:52,915
into telling stories in just one picture.

49
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:54,031
- When I was really young I would

50
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,012
draw pictures and I would show them to people

51
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,971
and they would react, and I'd really like that.

52
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,896
Like I'd love getting reactions out of people

53
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:05,523
with the things that drew and the stories that I tell,

54
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:08,268
and I wanted to get more reactions out of people

55
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,444
so I drew more and more and more.

56
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:15,381
- I have to say, like growing up I felt like

57
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,555
I had no ideas, like I was just the most

58
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,944
unoriginal, like, I always felt like artists

59
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:22,431
have to have like these kinda waterfalls of ideas,

60
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:25,038
endless amount of ideas, and I had like zero I felt.

61
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:29,574
- So I get most of my stories and my ideas from my life.

62
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:32,795
I think about a lot of stuff that's happened to me,

63
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:36,311
like when was the last time I was happy?

64
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:39,386
When was the last time I felt really sad?

65
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:43,973
When was the last time I cried or got really angry?

66
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:47,491
- Most of my stories originate from

67
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,529
my own personal experiences, and I think

68
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:54,270
there's a touchstone there that is very important

69
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,224
to the storyteller to find because it makes us honest.

70
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,388
I'm not just gathering kind of ideas

71
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:03,675
and chucking them together and there's a story.

72
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,002
No story comes ready made.

73
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,014
- One way is that I think long and hard

74
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,861
about my experiences in life and

75
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:15,022
moments in my life where I've had

76
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:19,267
what I kind of consider to be an epiphany.

77
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,679
I have gained some sort of insight

78
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,747
or learned something that I think

79
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,406
is really important to share with the world.

80
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,828
I think those are the kind of stories

81
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:30,394
that are really fun because they

82
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:33,729
only can come from you and your experience.

83
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,972
Nobody else can have the same insights

84
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:38,305
as you because they haven't lived the same life as you.

85
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,669
- No two people will experience life the same,

86
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:43,532
so no two people will tell a story the same way.

87
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:46,192
Think of this as a superpower we all have,

88
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,846
your unique perspective.

89
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:51,145
Only you see the world this way.

90
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:53,705
Now I want you to think about a memory you have.

91
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,405
It can be your most embarrassing memory,

92
00:03:56,405 --> 00:04:00,323
a frightening memory, or a time you were very surprised.

93
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,163
Whatever it is, it's a memory you remember vividly.

94
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:05,922
In this first exercise you'll have a chance

95
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:09,000
to express this memory in various ways. aimozhen.com/pixarinabox
